\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It was not yet 9 a.m., and Gary Page was drunk. The disabled handyman had a long history of schizophrenia and depression and, since his wife died in February, he had been struggling to hold his life together.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 That bright Saturday morning in March, something snapped. Page, 60, slit his wrists, grabbed a gun and climbed the stairs to his stepdaughter's place in the Pines Apartments in Harmony, Ind. He said he wanted to die. And then he called 911.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I want to shoot the cops," Page slurred to the dispatcher, prodding his stepdaughter to confirm that, yes, he had a gun. "I want them to shoot me."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Minutes later, Page's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  wish was granted. Two Clay County \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 sheriff's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 deputies\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  arrived to find that he had taken a neighbor hostage. They opened fire, striking him five times in the torso and once in the head. Page's gun later turned out to be a starter pistol, loaded only with blanks. His threats of violence turned out to be equally empty, the product of emotional instability and agonizing despair. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nationwide, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have shot and killed 124 people this year who, like Page, were in the throes of mental or emotional crisis, according to a Washington Post analysis. The dead account for a quarter of the 462 people shot to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the first six months of 2015.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The vast majority were armed, but in most cases, the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  who shot them were not responding to reports of a crime. More often, the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were called by relatives, neighbors or other bystanders worried that a mentally fragile person was behaving erratically, reports show. More than 50 people were explicitly suicidal.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 More than half of the killings involved \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  agencies that have not provided their \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  with state-of-the-art training to deal with the mentally ill. And in many cases, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  responded with tactics that quickly made a volatile situation even more dangerous.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Post analysis provides for the first time a national, real-time tally of the shooting \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 deaths\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of mentally distraught individuals at the hands of law enforcement. Criminal-justice experts say that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are often ill equipped to respond to such individuals - and that the encounters too often end in needless violence.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "This a national crisis," said Chuck Wexler, executive director of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Executive Research Forum, an independent research organization devoted to improving policing. "We have to get American \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to rethink how they handle encounters with the mentally ill. Training has to change."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 As a debate rages over the use of deadly force by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  particularly against minorities, The Post is tracking every \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 fatal\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shooting by a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  acting in the line of duty in 2015. Reporters are culling news reports, public records and other open sources on the Internet to log more than a dozen factors about each case, including the age and race of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 victim, whether the victim was armed\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and the circumstances that led to the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 fatal\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  encounter.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The FBI also logs \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 fatal\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shootings, but officials acknowledge that their data is far from complete. In the past four decades, the FBI has never recorded more than 460 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 fatal\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shootings in a single year. The Post hit that number in less than six months.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 For this article, The Post analyzed 124 killings in which the victim's mental health appeared to play a role, either because the person expressed suicidal intentions or because \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  or family members confirmed a history of mental illness. This approach probably understates the scope of the problem, experts said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In many ways, this subset mirrors the overall population of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shooting victims: They were overwhelmingly men, and more than half of them were white. Nine in 10 were armed with some kind of weapon, and most died close to home.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But there were also important distinctions. This group was more likely to wield a weapon less lethal than a firearm. Six had toy guns; 3 in 10 carried a blade, such as a knife or a machete - weapons that rarely prove deadly to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . According to data maintained by the FBI and other organizations, only three \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have been killed with an edged weapon in the past decade.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nearly a dozen of the mentally distraught people killed were military veterans, many of them suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of their service, according to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  or family members. Another was a former California Highway Patrol \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  who had been forced into retirement after enduring a severe beating during a traffic stop that left him suffering from depression and PTSD.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 And in 45 cases, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were called to help someone get medical treatment, or after the person had tried and failed to get treatment on his own.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In January, for instance, Jonathan Guillory, a white 32-year-old father of two who had worked as a military contractor in Afghanistan, was having what his widow called a mental health emergency. He sought help at a Veterans Affairs hospital in Arizona, his wife, Maria Garcia, told local reporters, but the busy hospital turned him away. Jean Schaefer, a spokeswoman for the Veterans Health Administration in Phoenix, said the hospital had no record of Guillory's visit.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Back home, Guillory dialed 911 twice and hung up. When \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  responded, he pulled a gun from his waistband and said, "I bet I can outdraw you," according to Maricopa \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  spokesman Ricardo Alvarado. They shot him six times.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The dead range in age from 15 to 86. At both ends of that spectrum, the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 victim\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was male, suicidal and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  with a gun. On average, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shot and killed someone who was in mental crisis every 36 hours in the first six months of this year. On April 25, three mentally ill men were gunned down within 10 hours.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 That afternoon, David Felix, a 24-year-old black man with schizophrenia, was killed by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the New York apartment building where he lived with other men undergoing treatment for mental health problems, according to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  reports. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  said he struck two \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  with a heavy \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  radio after they tried to serve him with a warrant for allegedly punching a friend in the face and stealing her purse.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Two hours later, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 sheriff's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 deputies\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Clermont, Fla., fatally shot Daniel Davis, a 58-year-old white man who had recently been released from a mental health facility, according to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  reports. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  say he threatened his stepfather and then a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 deputy\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  with a hunting knife.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 And shortly before midnight, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Victoria, Tex., shot Brandon Lawrence, a 25-year-old white man, a father of two toddlers and an Afghanistan war veteran who suffered from PTSD. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  said Lawrence approached them in an "aggressive manner" with a two-foot-long machete. They said they ordered him to drop it more than 30 times.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Lawrence's wife and another witness have disputed aspects of that account, saying that Lawrence, while armed, was not advancing and was obviously not in his right mind. Convinced someone was coming to kill him, Lawrence repeatedly asked \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  who they were and what they wanted, his wife said. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "He was clearly confused . . . but they didn't try to talk to him," said Lawrence's father, Bryon Lawrence, who works as an Illinois state prison guard.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Everyone I work with is a convicted felon; I can't just go up to them and shoot them," Bryon Lawrence said. "My boy is 25 years old, working 50 hours a week, paying taxes. He was in his own home when they showed up.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Within six minutes, they murdered him."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Victoria \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  declined to comment, citing the ongoing investigation.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  increasingly acknowledge that they have few effective tools for handling the mentally ill. In interviews, current and former \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  chiefs said that without large-scale \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  retraining, as well as a nationwide increase in mental health services, these deadly encounters will continue.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Severe budget cuts for psychiatric services - by as much as 30 percent in some states in recent years - have created a vacuum that local \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are increasingly asked to fill, they said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We as a society need to put more money and funding into treating the mentally ill. We need to work with these people . . . before they end in tragedy," said Mike Carter, the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  chief in Sand Springs, Okla., where \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in April shot and killed a 66-year-old white Vietnam veteran with PTSD. The man, Donald Allen, grew agitated after \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  asked him to stop firing a gun in his back yard.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 So far, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  departments generally have not risen to the challenge. Although new recruits typically spend nearly 60 hours learning to handle a gun, according to a recent survey by the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Executive Research Forum, they receive only eight hours of training to de-escalate tense situations and eight hours learning strategies for handling the mentally ill.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Otherwise, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are taught to employ tactics that tend to be counterproductive in such encounters, experts said. For example, most \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are trained to seize control when dealing with an \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed suspect,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  often through stern, shouted commands.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But yelling and pointing guns is "like pouring gasoline on a fire when you do that with the mentally ill," said Ron Honberg, policy director with the National Alliance on Mental Illness.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Sandy Jo MacArthur is an assistant chief who oversees "mental response teams" for the Los Angeles \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Department, a program considered to be a national model. MacArthur said her \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are trained to embrace tactics that may seem counterintuitive. Instead of rushing to take someone into custody, they try to slow things down and persuade the person to come with them. When possible, a psychologist or psychiatrist is on the scene.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The mentally ill "do not process what is happening like a normal criminal," MacArthur said. "There's a lot of white noise in their head."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 On the day he died in April, Daniel Covarrubias was taking powerful painkillers for a broken collarbone, hadn't eaten for days and was hallucinating. The 37-year-old Native American and Latino had gone to St. Clare Hospital near Tacoma, Wash., "to get the cameras out of his eyes," according to Ben Barcus, attorney for the Covarrubias family.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Covarrubias, who had a history of depression and drug addiction, was treated for "substance/medication induced psychotic disorder," according to medical records obtained by the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Five hours later, he was released "in stable condition," according to hospital spokesman Scott Thompson.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 As Covarrubias walked home, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  sirens began blaring behind him. For reasons that are unclear, Covarrubias dashed into Pinnacle Lumber and Plywood, scaled a 25-foot-tall stack of wood and crouched to hide, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  records show.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 His mother, Marilyn Covarrubias, speculates that he may have believed the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were after him. "I think he thought the sirens were for him," she said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Alarmed lumberyard employees thought so, too, and called \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to report a man hiding on the property. Within minutes, two Lakewood, Wash., \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were standing at the base of the lumber stack, shouting up at Covarrubias to "show your hands."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 What happened next is in dispute. Lakewood \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Chief Mike Zaro has said  Covarrubias "raised up with a dark object in his hand and pointed it at the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in a manner that was consistent with pointing a firearm." Barcus said lumberyard employees "didn't see pointing." Managers at Pinnacle Lumber declined to comment.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In any case, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  opened fire, hitting Covarrubias five times, including once in the head, according to Barcus. The dark object in his hand turned out to be a cellphone.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Barcus criticized the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers'\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  failure "to de-escalate this situation."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "They arrived at the lumberyard, and six minutes later Covarrubias was dead," Barcus said. "It doesn't appear they know how to deal with the mentally ill."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Lakewood \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  spokesman Chris Lawler said the department works with mental health experts and that both \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  involved in the shooting had received training to handle such encounters.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He declined to comment further, saying the investigation was still pending.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 One of the youngest shooting victims was Kristiana Coignard, a 17-year-old white girl who walked out of the darkness one evening in January and into the empty lobby of a Longview, Tex., \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  station. In her waistband, she had a knife. And on her palm, she had written the words "I have a gun."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Coignard did not have a gun, nor any clear reason for going to the station that night. Her case underscores a central difficulty for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  who encounter a mentally ill person: It can be almost impossible to determine intent, or judge capacity to inflict harm.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Coignard appeared to pose a threat, but unlike someone committing a robbery, her intentions were obscure.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Since the age of 12, Coignard had displayed signs of mental illness; she regularly took medication for depression and bipolar disorder, according to her father, Erik Coignard. She dropped out of high school a year before graduation, but she later obtained a GED and had plans to attend college.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "She wanted to be a counselor in the mental health area because she said she felt that they failed her," said her stepmother, Elizabeth Coignard.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 On the day she died, Kristiana Coignard met with the counselor she had seen for years. She entered the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  station shortly before 6:30 p.m.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In a video released by Longview \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Coignard at first seems hesitant. She wanders in, checks her mobile phone, then approaches a phone on the far wall that connects to dispatch. After a minute or so, she picks up the receiver and asks to speak to an \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 An \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  arrives and addresses Coignard, who appears to show him her palm. The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  struggles with the teen, forcing her into a chair, then down to the ground. She reaches for the knife, and the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  draws his gun.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 As two more \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  arrive, Coignard stands and charges at the first \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  who opens fire. Coignard falls to the floor, struck four times.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 As colleagues comfort the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  paramedics arrive, perform CPR on Coignard and carry her body away on a stretcher.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Longview \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Chief Don Dingler has defended the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers'\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  actions. The video shows "time was a factor," Dingler told reporters. "There was no time for the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to use other means."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Coignard's parents strongly disagree. Though they are baffled by their daughter's actions that day - was it a suicide attempt? - they don't understand why three \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  couldn't subdue their slight teenage daughter without resorting to deadly force.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Whatever her motives, "she should still be here," Erik Coignard said. "She was asking for help, and she was failed when that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  failed to take control of the situation. . . . This shouldn't have ended this way."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mental health experts say most \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  departments need to quadruple the amount of training that recruits receive for dealing with the mentally ill, requiring as much time in the crisis-intervention classroom as \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  currently spend on the shooting range. But training is no panacea, experts caution.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The mentally ill are unpredictable. Moreover, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  often have no way of knowing when they are dealing with a mentally ill person. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are routinely dispatched with information that is incomplete or wrong. And in a handful of cases this year, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were prodded to shoot someone who wanted to die.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 That was the case with Matthew Hoffman, a 32-year-old white man who had long struggled with mental illness, according to family members. After breaking up with his girlfriend, Hoffman walked up to San Francisco \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in January outside a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  station in the bustling Mission District. He pulled a gun from his waistband, pointed it at the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and advanced in silence.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The startled \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  fired 10 shots, three of which struck Hoffman. They later discovered that his weapon was a BB gun. And they found a note on his mobile phone, addressed to the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  who shot him.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "You did nothing wrong," it said. "You ended the life of a man who was too much of a coward to do it himself."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Grace Gatpandan, San Francisco \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Department spokeswoman, said the department offers crisis-intervention training. But those classes are designed primarily to teach \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to handle someone threatening to jump off a bridge, not someone pointing a gun in a crowded tourist area.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "When \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are faced with a deadly situation, when there is a gun pointed at a cop, there is no time to go into mental health measures," Gatpandan said. "There was nothing we could have done. This is one of those tragedies."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In the region around Harmony, Ind., few local \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  agencies have the money for crisis-intervention training, said attorney Craig McKee, who represents the Clay County \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Sheriff's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Office. The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 deputies\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  who responded to Gary Page's call had not received such training, he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "They need help from professionals to prepare them for this," McKee said. "Society is not necessarily handling mental health issues well, so the number of encounters like this is escalating."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But Clay County \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Sheriff\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Paul Harden said he is not sure any amount of training would have helped his \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 deputies\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  that day.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "No \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  I know wants to be involved in an incident like this," Harden said in a written statement. "Even when I am confident that we handled the situation the right way, as I do here, it can't help but shake people."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Family members still wipe away tears when discussing Page's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  But his sister-in-law, Nyla Young, said they do not blame \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I pray every night for the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  who had to make that decision, because they didn't go to work that day and want to have to make that decision," Young said. "Gary made them make that decision. Gary wanted to die. And Gary got what he wanted that day."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Page, who was white, married Young's sister Hester in 1997, and the two were inseparable, she said. When Hester got sick about six years ago, Page became her primary caregiver. He had stopped working after securing disability payments for a back injury. So he was able to take her to doctor's appointments, bathe and dress her, and carry her from their bed to their living room to watch TV.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In February, Hester slipped into a coma  and died. Her \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  crushed Page, Young said. He had vowed to keep her alive and had devoted years to that mission. Now, he was alone.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A week before the shooting, Page called Young and asked her to pick up her sister's ashes, a move she now regrets.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "That was probably the final straw," Young said. "He wasn't taking care of her ashes any longer, so he had nothing left to live for."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Page lived in the Pines Apartments, downstairs from his stepdaughter. With \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  on the way, a neighbor unaware of the unfolding drama emerged from her apartment and asked Page to quiet down, according to a detailed account of the shooting prepared by a local prosecutor, who cleared the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 deputies\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of wrongdoing. Page took the woman hostage and waited for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Three \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 deputies\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  soon arrived. One approached through the front door and ordered Page to drop his weapon. The enraged man continued to scream at his hostage. Then Page spotted two more \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 deputies\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  approaching through the back door.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Don't do it. . . . I'll shoot!" he shouted and raised his gun.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Brian Helmer, who had been with the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 sheriff's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  department for less than two years, fired twice. The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 deputy\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  who had come in through the front, Joshua Clarke, heard the gunfire and shot six times more.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 As Page lay bleeding, Helmer and Clarke quickly transitioned into rescue mode. In a scene captured by a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  body camera, the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  secured Page's weapon, realizing for the first time that it was not loaded with real bullets. They tore off his sweatpants and used them to stanch the blood pouring from a wound in his chest.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 When Page stopped breathing, the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  performed CPR. A bystander urged them to let Page die, according to the prosecutor's report. Instead, the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  asked for Page's first name and spoke to him as they pumped his chest.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Moments later, paramedics arrived. In the video's final seconds, Helmer walked away from Page's body, breathing heavily and sobbing. Then the video ends.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Gary Page was dead.

\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In an alley in Denver, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  gunned down a 17-year-old girl joyriding in a stolen car. In the backwoods of North Carolina, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  opened fire on a gun-wielding moonshiner. And in a high-rise apartment in Birmingham, Ala., \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shot an elderly man after his son asked them to make sure he was okay. Douglas Harris, 77, answered the door with a gun.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The three are among at least 385 people shot and killed by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  nationwide during the first five months of this year, more than two a day, according to a Washington Post analysis. That is more than twice the rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 fatal\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shootings tallied by the federal government over the past decade, a count that officials concede is incomplete.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "These shootings are grossly underreported," said Jim Bueermann, a former \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  chief and president of the Washington-based \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Foundation, a nonprofit organization dedicated to improving law enforcement. "We are never going to reduce the number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shootings if we don't begin to accurately track this information." 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A national debate is raging about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  use of deadly force, especially against minorities. To understand why and how often these shootings occur, The Washington Post is compiling a database of every \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 fatal\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shooting by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in 2015, as well as of every \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  killed by gunfire in the line of duty. The Post looked exclusively at shootings, not killings by other means, such as stun guns and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 deaths\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  custody.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Using interviews, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  reports, local news accounts and other sources, The Post tracked more than a dozen details about each killing through Friday, including the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 victim's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  race, whether the person was \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and the circumstances that led to the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 fatal\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  encounter. The result is an unprecedented examination of these shootings, many of which began as minor incidents and suddenly escalated into violence.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Among The Post's findings:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 l About half the victims were white, half minority. But the demographics shifted sharply among the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 unarmed\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 victims,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  two-thirds of whom were black or Hispanic. Overall, blacks were killed at three times the rate of whites or other minorities when adjusting by the population of the census tracts where the shootings occurred.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 l The vast majority of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 victims\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  - more than 80 percent - were \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  with potentially lethal objects, primarily guns, but also knives, machetes, revving vehicles and, in one case, a nail gun.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 l Forty-nine people had no weapon, while the guns wielded by 13 others turned out to be toys. In all, 16 percent were either carrying a toy or were unarmed.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 l The dead ranged in age from 16 to 83. Eight were children younger than 18, including Jessie Hernandez, 17, who was shot three times by Denver \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as she and a carload of friends allegedly tried to run them down.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Post analysis also sheds light on the situations that most commonly gave rise to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 fatal\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shootings. About half of the time, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were responding to people seeking help with domestic disturbances and other complex social situations: A homeless person behaving erratically. A boyfriend threatening violence. A son trying to kill himself.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Ninety-two victims - nearly a quarter of those killed - were identified by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  or family members as mentally ill.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In Miami Gardens, Fla., Catherine Daniels called 911 when she couldn't persuade her son, Lavall Hall, a 25-year-old black man, to come in out of the cold early one morning in February. A diagnosed schizophrenic who stood 5-foot-4 and weighed barely 120 pounds, Hall was wearing boxer shorts and an undershirt and waving a broomstick when \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  arrived. They tried to stun him with a Taser gun and then shot him.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The other half of shootings involved non-domestic crimes, such as robberies, or the routine duties that occupy patrol \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  such as serving warrants.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nicholas T. Thomas, a 23-year-old black man, was killed in March when \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Smyrna, Ga., tried to serve him with a warrant for failing to pay $170 in felony probation fees. Thomas fled the Goodyear tire shop where he worked as a mechanic, and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shot into his car.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Although race was a dividing line, those who died by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  gunfire often had much in common. Most were poor and had a history of run-ins with law enforcement over mostly small-time crimes, sometimes because they were emotionally troubled.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Both things were true of Daniel Elrod, a 39-year-old white man. Elrod had been arrested at least 16 times over the past 15 years; he was taken into protective custody twice last year because Omaha \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  feared he might hurt himself.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 On the day he died in February, Elrod robbed a Family Dollar store. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  said he ran when \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  arrived, jumping on top of a BMW in the parking lot and yelling, "Shoot me, shoot me." Elrod, who was unarmed, was shot three times as he made a "mid-air leap" to clear a barbed-wire fence, according to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  records.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dozens of other people also died while fleeing from \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  The Post analysis shows, including a significant proportion - 20 percent - of those who were unarmed. Running is such a provocative act that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  experts say there is a name for the injury \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  inflict on suspects afterward: a "foot tax."
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are authorized to use deadly force only when they fear for their lives or the lives of others. So far, just three of the 385 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 fatal\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shootings have resulted in an \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  being charged with a crime - less than 1 percent. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The low rate mirrors the findings of a Post investigation in April that found that of thousands of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 fatal\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shootings over the past decade, only 54 had produced criminal charges. Typically, those cases involved layers of damning evidence challenging the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  account. Of the cases resolved, most \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were cleared or acquitted.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In all three 2015 cases in which charges were filed, videos emerged showing the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shooting a suspect during or after a foot chase:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 l In South Carolina, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Michael Slager was charged with murder in the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of Walter Scott, a 50-year-old black man, who ran after a traffic stop. Slager's attorney declined to comment.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 l In Oklahoma, reserve \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 deputy\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Robert Bates was charged with second-degree manslaughter 10 days after he killed Eric Harris, a 44-year-old black man. Bates's attorney, Clark Brewster, characterized the shooting as a "legitimate accident," noting that Bates mistakenly grabbed his gun instead of his Taser.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 l And in Pennsylvania, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Lisa Mearkle was charged with criminal homicide six weeks after she shot and killed David Kassick, a 59-year-old white man, who refused to pull over for a traffic stop. Her attorney did not return calls for comment.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In many other cases, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  agencies have determined that the shootings were justified. But many law enforcement leaders are calling for greater scrutiny.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 After nearly a year of protests against \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  brutality and with a White House task force report calling for reforms, a dozen current and former \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  chiefs and other criminal justice officials said \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  must begin to accept responsibility for the carnage. They argue that a large number of the killings examined by The Post could be blamed on poor policing.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We have to get beyond what is legal and start focusing on what is preventable. Most are preventable," said Ronald L. Davis, a former \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  chief who heads the Justice Department's Office of Community Oriented Policing Services.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  "need to stop chasing down suspects, hopping fences and landing on top of someone with a gun," Davis said. "When they do that, they have no choice but to shoot."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 As a start, criminologists say the federal government should systematically analyze \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shootings. Currently, the FBI struggles to gather the most basic data. Reporting is voluntary, and since 2011, less than 3 percent of the nation's 18,000 state and local \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  agencies have reported \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 fatal\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shootings by their \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to the FBI. As a result, FBI records over the past decade show only about 400 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shootings a year - an average of 1.1 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 deaths\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  per day.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to The Post's analysis, the daily \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  toll so far for 2015 is close to 2.6. At that pace, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  will have shot and killed nearly 1,000 people by the end of the year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We have to understand the phenomena behind these \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 fatal\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  encounters," Bueermann said. "There is a compelling social need for this, but a lack of political will to make it happen."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 For the vast majority of departments, a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 fatal\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shooting is a rare event. Only 306 agencies have recorded one so far this year, and most had only one, the Post analysis shows.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 However, 19 state and local departments were involved in at least three \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 fatal\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shootings. Los Angeles \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  lead the nation with eight. The latest occurred May 5, when Brendon Glenn, a 29-year-old homeless black man, was shot after an altercation outside a Venice bar.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Oklahoma City \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have killed four people, including an 83-year-old white man wielding a machete.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We want to do the most we can to keep from taking someone's life, even under the worst circumstances," said Oklahoma City \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Chief William Citty. "There are just going to be some shootings that are unavoidable."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In Bakersfield, Calif., all three of the department's killings occurred in a span of 10 days in March. The most recent involved Adrian Hernandez, a 22-year-old Hispanic man accused of raping his roommate, dousing her with flammable liquid and setting fire to their home.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 After a manhunt, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cornered Hernandez, who jumped out of his car holding a BB gun. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  opened fire, and some Bakersfield residents say they are glad the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  did.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I'm relieved he can't come back here, to be honest with you," said Brian Haver, who lives next door to the house Hernandez torched. "If he came out holding a gun, what were they supposed to do?"
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Although law enforcement officials say many shootings are preventable, that is not always true. In dozens of cases, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rushed into volatile situations and saved lives. Examples of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  heroism abound.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In Tempe, Ariz., \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rescued a 25-year-old woman who had been stabbed and tied up and was screaming for help. Her boyfriend, Matthew Metz, a 26-year-old white man, also stabbed an \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  before he was shot and killed, according to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  records.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In San Antonio, a patrol \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  heard gunshots and rushed to the parking lot of Dad's Karaoke bar to find a man shooting into the crowd. Richard Castilleja, a 29-year-old Latino, had hit two men and was still unloading his weapon when he was shot and killed, according to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  records.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 And in Los Angeles County, a Hawthorne \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  working overtime was credited with saving the life of a 12-year-old boy after a frantic woman in a gray Mercedes pulled alongside the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and said three men in a white Cadillac were following her and her son.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Seconds later, the Cadillac roared up. Robert Washington, a 37-year-old black man, jumped out and began shooting into the woman's car.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "He had two revolvers and started shooting both of them with no words spoken. He shot and killed the mom, and then he started shooting at the kid," said Eddie Aguirre, a Los Angeles County homicide detective investigating the case.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 deputy\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  got out of his patrol car and started shooting," Aguirre said. "He saved the boy's life."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In about half the shootings, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were responding to non-domestic criminal situations, with robberies and traffic infractions ranking among the most common offenses. Nearly half of blacks and other minorities were killed under such circumstances. So were about a third of whites.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In North Carolina, a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  searching for clues in a hit-and-run case approached a green and white mobile home owned by Lester Brown, a 58-year-old white man. On the front porch, the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  spotted an illegal liquor still. He called for backup, and drug agents soon arrived with a search warrant.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  knocked on the door and asked Brown to secure his dog. Instead, Brown dashed upstairs and grabbed a Soviet SKS rifle, according to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  reports.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Neighbor Joe Guffey Jr. told a local TV reporter that he was sitting at home with his dogs when the shooting started: "Pow, pow, pow, pow." Brown was hit seven times and pronounced dead at the scene.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 While Brown allegedly stood his ground, many others involved in criminal activity chose to flee when confronted by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Kassick, for example, attracted Mearkle's attention because he had expired vehicle inspection stickers. On the day he died, Kassick was on felony probation for drunken driving and had drugs in his system, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and autopsy reports show.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 After failing to pull over, Kassick drove to his sister's house in Hummelstown, Pa., jumped out of the car and ran. Mearkle repeatedly struck Kassick with a stun gun and then shot him twice in the back while he was face-down in the snow.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Jimmy Ray Robinson, a.k.a. the "Honey Bun Bandit," allegedly robbed five convenience stores in Central Texas, grabbing some of the sticky pastries along the way. Robinson, a 51-year-old black man, fled when he spotted Waco \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  staking out his home.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Robinson sped off in reverse in a green Ford Explorer. It got stuck in the mud, and four Waco \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  opened fire.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "They think they can outrun the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  They don't realize how dangerous it is," said Samuel Lee Reid, executive director of the Atlanta Citizen Review Board, which investigates \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shootings and recently launched a "Don't Run" campaign. "The panic sets in," and "all they can think is that they don't want to get caught and go back to jail."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The most troubling cases began with a cry for help.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 About half the shootings occurred after family members, neighbors or strangers sought help from \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  because someone was suicidal, behaving erratically or threatening violence.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Take Shane Watkins, a 39-year-old white man, who died in his mother's driveway in Moulton, Ala.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Watkins had never been violent, and family members were not afraid for their safety when they called Lawrence County \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 sheriff's deputies\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in March. But Watkins, who suffered from bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, was off his medication. Days earlier, he had declared himself the "god of the fifth element" and demanded whiskey and beer so he could "cleanse the earth with it," said his sister, Yvonne Cote.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Then he started threatening to shoot himself and his dog, Slayer. His mother called Cote, who called 911. Cote got back on the phone with her mother, who watched Watkins walk onto the driveway holding a box cutter to his chest. A patrol car pulled up, and Cote heard her mother yell: "Don't shoot! He doesn't have a gun!"
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Then I heard the gunshots," Cote said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Lawrence County \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 sheriff's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  officials declined to comment and have refused to release documents related to the case.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "There are so many unanswered questions," she said. "All he had was a box cutter. Wasn't there some other way for them to handle this?"
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Catherine Daniels called \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  for the same reason. "I wanted to get my son help," she said. Instead, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Peter Ehrlich and Eddo Trimino fired their stun guns after Hall hit them with the metal end of the broomstick, according to investigative documents.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Please don't hurt my child," Daniels pleaded, in a scene captured by a camera mounted on the dash of one of the patrol cars.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Get on the f---ing ground or you're dead!" Trimino shouted. Then he fired five shots.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  spokesman Mike Wright declined to comment on the case. Daniels said no one from the city has contacted her. "I haven't received anything. No apology, nothing."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But hours after her son was killed, Daniels said, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  investigating the shooting dropped off a six-pack of Coca-Cola.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I regret calling them," Daniels said. "They took my son's life."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 As part of an ongoing examination of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  accountability, The Washington Post has attempted to track every \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 fatal\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shooting by law enforcement nationwide since January, as well as the number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  who were fatally shot in the line of duty.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Post compiled the data using news reports, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  records, open sources on the Internet and other original reporting. Several organizations, including Killed by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police and  Fatal\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Encounters, have been collecting information about people who die during encounters with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Post documented only those incidents in which a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , while on duty, shot and killed a civilian. Cases in which \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were shot to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were also tabulated.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 To comprehensively examine the issue, a database was compiled with information about each incident, including the deceased's age, race, gender, location and general circumstances. The Post also noted whether \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  reported that the person was armed and, if so, with what type of weapon.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The FBI and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention log \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 fatal\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shootings, but the data the two federal agencies gather is incomplete. The Post analyzed a decade of FBI and CDC records as part of the study.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 To examine racial and economic patterns, The Post identified the location of every \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 fatal\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shooting and compared it with the composition of the surrounding census tract.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The data, which will be collected through the end of the year, will be made public at a future date.

\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  BODY:
\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Don't confuse the Department of Justice with the cavalry.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 When it comes to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  department reform, "Too many community activists think the Justice Department is going to save us," said Samuel Walker, a professor emeritus at the University of Nebraska who has written extensively on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  accountability.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Unofficial reports that Palm Beach County \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Sheriff's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Office shootings had drawn DOJ's attention began surfacing days after The Palm Beach Post and WPTV NewsChannel 5 published a series detailing 15 years of shootings. Last week, Palm Beach County \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Sheriff\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Ric Bradshaw said the FBI is investigating a single, as-yet unidentified PBSO incident.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Federal intervention could lead to sweeping changes in long-established \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  practice. However, getting that kind of formal attention is as difficult as it is rare. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 True, there are plenty of recent DOJ interventions: In 2011, it investigated \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  departments in Miami and New Orleans; in 2013, Cleveland; in 2014 Ferguson, Mo.; and, last week, the department officially opened a civil rights investigation into the Baltimore \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Department, after riots followed a man's in-custody \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In every case, DOJ was seen as the last, best hope for policing the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But for two decades, the special civil rights section handling investigations has been buffeted by politics and hamstrung by scant resources. And some departments, including the Miami \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Department, revert to poor or even lethal policing as soon as DOJ leaves town.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Question of resources
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Besieged with hundreds of requests for help every year from advocacy groups, community leaders, lawyers, city councils, mayors and even \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  chiefs, DOJ's civil rights section is simply too small for the task, said Walker.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "You have 18,000 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  departments, a lot of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  misconduct and extremely limited resources," he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "They couldn't possibly do it all."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 For instance, when Michael Brown was shot by a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Ferguson last August, prompting riots, looting and national outrage, DOJ opened an investigation into the Ferguson \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  department. Officials went through 35,000 pages of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  records and thousands of emails. They brought in statistical experts to analyze traffic stops, searches, citations, and arrests. They pored over court fees and municipal budgets.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 That was just one tiny \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  department: 54 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It's roughly the same number of lawyers in the entire DOJ section responsible for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  department cases, according to a recent study into DOJ investigations by The Marshall Project, a nonprofit advocacy group.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 That helps explain why, since Congress first gave DOJ authority to investigate \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  department misconduct in 1994, the agency has averaged just three investigations a year, said Stephen Rushin, a visiting professor of law at the University of Illinois and an expert on DOJ investigations of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  misconduct.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Why us?"
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Why DOJ picks one \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  department over another can be baffling. When DOJ announced it would investigate Steubenville, Ohio, in 1996, the city manager protested, "Why us? Why a small town instead of Chicago?"
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There's no clear answer, for instance, as to why the FBI would show interest in Palm Beach County and not Chicago.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 And DOJ may want it that way.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "There is no checklist that says, 'If I do these things, I am going to fall into the investigation bucket, and if I do these other things, I am going to fall outside the investigation bucket,'" DOJ special litigation chief Jonathan Smith said in a 2013 meeting with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  chiefs from throughout the country.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Keeping \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  departments guessing can be a useful tool, Rushin suggested. After all, the prospect of winning DOJ's "terrible lottery" might prompt reforms just to keep the agency away.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In fact, said Walker, after 20 years of DOJ settlements, every \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  department in the country already has a road map for DOJ-blessed reforms.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Bradshaw, for instance, examined DOJ reviews in Albuquerque, N.M., and elsewhere to develop policies on shootings. It's one reason he insists any federal investigation will confirm that PBSO is far ahead of the curve when it comes to what DOJ wants.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I don't care if they come in here or not," said Bradshaw last year. The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 sheriff\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  made his comments shortly after attorney Jack Scarola, who represents a bicyclist shot and paralyzed by a PBSO \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 deputy\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in 2013, wrote then-Attorney General Eric Holder and asked that DOJ investigate.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I would be very confident that if they looked at our policies, they looked at our procedures, they looked at how we investigate these things, we're going to be so far ahead of everybody else, you have no idea," Bradshaw said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Problems elsewhere
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But DOJ has faulted departments in other cities for certain types of shootings that also occurred in Palm Beach County: shooting \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 unarmed\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  or mentally ill \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suspects\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , shootings in which larger-than-expected numbers of victims are racial or ethnic minorities and a record of rarely faulting a law enforcement \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  actions.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In three \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 fatal\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  PBSO shootings since 2010, the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suspects\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  weren't \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Further, roughly one in every four PBSO shootings since 2000, including those that did not injure or kill a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suspect\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , also involved \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 unarmed\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suspects\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , a figure higher than at least two cities DOJ has criticized.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Also in the past five years, a 17-year-old with Down syndrome and a mentally ill man who was not competent to stand trial were shot. A diagnosed schizophrenic was shot and killed. So was a teenager with serious mental illnesses who was throwing rocks at a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 deputy.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Since 2000, PBSO has ruled all but one of 45 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 fatal\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shootings were justified. Since 2010, every PBSO shooting was ruled justified, a 100 percent clearance rate. By contrast, DOJ found Miami's 87 percent clearance rate unrealistically high.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Finally, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 deputies\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have disproportionately shot at black people, particularly young men. Although African-Americans make up 15 percent of people living in the area PBSO patrols, they represent 35 percent of those shot at by PBSO. One in three was unarmed.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Political winds
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 No single questionable shooting, or even several shootings, automatically means DOJ will come knocking.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 For one thing, the number of investigations and settlements closely tracks who occupies the White House.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 During the Bill Clinton era, when legislation enabling investigations passed in the wake of the Rodney King beating, DOJ promptly opened a handful of cases.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 President George W. Bush, on the other hand, expressed reluctance to become involved in local law enforcement issues.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Policies and priorities are expected to shift with administrations. However, in the Bush years, a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 deputy\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  assistant attorney general overseeing the DOJ division handling \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  investigations went beyond policy shifts, according to a DOJ inspector general inquiry.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The report concluded Bradley Schlozman weeded out or refused to hire attorneys not affiliated with Republicans or conservative groups, and expressed a desire to avoid attorneys involved in "some crazy liberal organization ... I just want to make sure we don't start confining ourselves to, you know, Politburo members because they happen to be a member of some, you know, psychopathic left-wing organization."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 However, another assistant attorney general interviewed by the inspector general said Schlozman wasn't doing anything out of the ordinary: Under Clinton, he said, there was a virtual ban on hiring conservatives.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Schlozman served between 2003 and 2006. Between 2004 and 2008, new investigations of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  departments dropped sharply. Not one reform agreement with a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  department was finalized, and many investigations simply were closed.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 After Barack Obama was elected, DOJ priorities changed again.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Eric Holder ramped up the number of investigations, picking up speed as Obama neared reelection: 15 new investigations or major settlements in the past three years.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Repeat offenders
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 However, charges against individuals are rarely open and shut: No charges against a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were brought in the Michael Brown shooting, for instance, which triggered the Ferguson unrest.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 And when DOJ investigates a department, there's no guarantee reforms will stick.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Take Miami. After 13 Miami \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were indicted for conspiring to block an investigation into \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shootings, DOJ in 2002 launched its first investigation at the request of then-Mayor Joe Carollo and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Chief Raul Martinez.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Miami pledged voluntary changes, including stronger policies, better training and thorough investigations into shootings as well as other uses of force.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 For 20 months, not a single \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  fired a gun.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 By 2006, after that period ended, DOJ became alarmed at how \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were using force on suspects, including lethal force. It sent a letter to the department, and Miami agreed to restrict shootings and better investigate them.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Then DOJ withdrew.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Shootings began again.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Between 2008 and 2011, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shot at civilians 33 times. In a matter of months, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  killed six young African-American men.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In February 2011, Travis McNeil became the seventh.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Reaching for cellphone
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 McNeil and his cousin, Kareem Williams, were pulled over after leaving a bar.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It was a high-powered traffic stop: Miami \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and federal agents had been combing the streets as part of a joint effort to arrest gang members.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Three unmarked cars drew up to McNeil's Kia Sorrento, effectively boxing him in. Miami \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Reynaldo Goyos drew his gun, got within a foot of McNeil's open window and fired three shots, killing him.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 McNeil had ducked toward the floorboard, Goyos said later, and could have been reaching for a gun. There was no gun, only two cellphones.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There were other incidents. One \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  fired because a motorist was reaching for his wallet after he had been told to provide identification. At other times, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  literally could not shoot straight: Bullets aimed at suspects were found lodged in the homes and cars of bystanders.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In 2011, DOJ opened its second investigation in 12 years, concluding that it was time for "court-enforceable" remedies.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Another way?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Las Vegas tried a different tack.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In 2011, two weeks after The Las Vegas Review-Journal reported many \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shootings of suspects could have been avoided, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shot and killed an unarmed, mentally ill Gulf War veteran.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A hail of criticism followed. But instead of an investigation by DOJ's special litigation section, DOJ's Community Oriented Policing Services division led a review.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The COPS division has no legal authority to enforce its recommendations, a fact that led some critics to doubt its effectiveness.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But the process was praised as faster, cheaper and more cooperative, thus generating change more quickly. And three years after the COPS report was published, there's evidence that it worked, said William Sousa, director of the University of Nevada's Center for Crime and Justice Policy.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The number of shootings by Las Vegas Metro \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Department \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  overall is down, he said, and when shootings do occur, the circumstances are more understandable -- almost all of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suspects\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have been \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Regardless of which DOJ division intervenes, reforms can work, Sousa said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 And regardless of whether DOJ is investigating a single shooting, such as in Palm Beach County, or an entire department, he said law enforcement officials will want to take their concerns seriously: "The federal government doesn't usually have an interest in investing resources in areas where they don't have a great chance of winning."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 What you need to know
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ~HOA~128~128~ While some see the U.S. Department of Justice as the ultimate authority over local \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  departments, it's rare for the feds to get involved, and, even when they do, their reforms can lead to little change.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ~HOA~128~128~ Further, DOJ investigations are political and depend on who is occupying the White House.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ~HOA~128~128~ Still, DOJ has left a litany of reforms over 20 years, a blueprint Palm Beach County \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Sheriff\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Ric Bradshaw says he considers, even as his agency has justified 44 of 45 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 fatal\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shootings since 2000.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 When the Justice Department comes knocking
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Three DOJ approaches:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ~HOA~128~128~ Investigates entire departments to determine whether a "pattern or practice" of civil rights violations exists. May impose reforms and force cities to pay for monitoring.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ~HOA~128~128~ Investigates individual \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , including those who shot \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 unarmed\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suspects\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , to determine whether they used "objectively unreasonable force." May bring criminal charges.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ~HOA~128~128~ Sends in Community Oriented Policing Services division to investigate or oversee investigation of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  departments. Makes nonbinding recommendations for reform.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Post and NewsChannel 5 found that the Palm Beach County \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Sheriff's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Office has cleared 97 percent of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 fatal\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shootings since 2000 and that evidence is ignored in the investigations.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A dispute over a change in party plans led to the slaying of a Jacksonville woman, whose boyfriend was charged Thursday with murder, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  said in releasing new details Friday.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Calvin Tyrone Andrews Jr., 36, is charged with murder in the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of LaBreka Brittany Evans, 29. Both lived in a home in the 2500 block of Woodland Street.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Andrews was initially charged with aggravated domestic battery after Evans was shot in the chest April 26. She was shot at their home off Moncrief Road after the couple began arguing and pushing and shoving over a change in a party they were planning, said Assistant Chief Chris Butler.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Andrews initially told a neighbor Evans shot herself before driving her to the hospital. The neighbor told \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  that Evans was heard saying, "Help me, don't let him take me."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A witness took possession of children, ages 6 and 10, at the home. Evans was their mother, while Andrews is the father of one of the children, Butler said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Evans was listed in life-threatening condition and died two days later. Butler said \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  investigated domestic incidents involving the couple in 2008 and 2012.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The call came about 1:30 p.m. after the man fired shots at his wife as she left the home on Florida 121 in a vehicle, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Sheriff\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Joey Dobson said. She was not injured.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dobson said the special response team surrounded the home and filled it with gas to try to get the man to come out.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 When that didn't work, members of the team entered the home about 5:50 p.m. and found the man dead from a gunshot wound, Dobson said.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Timothy Paul Anderson was charged with shooting a firearm within a private residence and two counts of possession of a firearm by a felon.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The standoff began about 9 p.m. after a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 deputy\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was dispatched to a home when a 911 caller hung up abruptly, the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Sheriff's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Office said.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Griffin Scott Hudgins, 18, was charged with possession of a firearm on school property. That's after a K-9 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  dog alerted authorities to his Ford Explorer during a sniff check in the parking lot, and the Smith and Wesson revolver, loaded with five rounds, was found in the trunk, according to the St. Johns County \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Sheriff's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Office.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The student was automatically suspended and will go before the county school district's discipline committee to determine whether further punishment is warranted, district spokeswoman Christina Langston said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Hudgins told school staff at the scene that he knew the gun was inside the vehicle, according to an arrest report. Also found inside the vehicle was a retractable metal baton, according to the report.

\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  BODY:
\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Marleta House struggled for years to stop hating the Baltimore \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  who shot and killed her husband in 1999 after mistaking his cellphone for a gun. "I don't hate him now," said House, who lives in Dundalk. "He has to answer to a higher power."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But the 45-year-old MTA bus driver remains just as frustrated today that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Christopher Graul was not charged and that Baltimore prosecutors never bothered to tell her why.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Most families do not see \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  charged and tried in a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  resulting from an encounter with city \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  In fact, before State's Attorney Marilyn J. Mosby charged six \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of Freddie Gray, just five city \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  during the past three decades have faced criminal prosecution for on-duty actions that resulted in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  according to interviews with experts, news reports, government data and court records. One was found guilty; the verdict was overturned on appeal. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 While officials acknowledge that there is no comprehensive historical data on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -involved \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 deaths,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  the period since 2006 provides a telling sample. Sixty-seven people died in encounters with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  over that period, according to the Baltimore \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Department, and two \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  faced criminal charges in those incidents. One, who was on duty when a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 fatal\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shooting took place, was acquitted. Another, who was off duty at a nightclub, was convicted and sentenced to 15 years in a separate shooting.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 That illustrates the high bar Mosby faces as she seeks to turn her charges into convictions. Four \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the Gray case face charges that range from involuntary manslaughter to second-degree-murder; the two others face lesser charges.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It's very difficult to get verdicts against the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 " said A. Dwight Pettit, an attorney who has filed dozens of civil lawsuits alleging \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  brutality, including one he lost involving the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of House's husband. "People do not want to believe -- before the advent of cameras and cellphones -- that the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  would do that type of malicious conduct."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 House and other relatives of those who died in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  encounters hope Mosby's prosecution and a federal investigation of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Department will help change a prosecutorial process that they say favors \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and fosters further brutality.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "With the Freddie Gray case, at least someone can have justice," House said. "They will never have closure. It's just a sad situation. You're leaving kids without fathers, wives without husbands, mothers without sons. With no answers."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Policing experts say the reason Baltimore \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  avoid charges is clear: They are frequently thrust into dangerous situations in one of the nation's most violent cities and must protect themselves, their partners and others in the vicinity.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "As horrible as it is, the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  can do it right by the book and someone may tragically lose their life," said Bill Johnson, executive director of the National Association of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Organizations.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  involved in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 deaths\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are intensely scrutinized -- by internal affairs units, prosecutors, the news media, lawyers, civilian review boards and, sometimes, federal investigators, he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I don't think it's correct for people to say that these things get swept under the carpet," Johnson said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mosby and predecessors Gregg L. Bernstein and Patricia C. Jessamy declined to comment for this article, as did the Baltimore \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Department and the Fraternal Order of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Lodge 3.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But other prosecutors say the decision to charge an \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  must follow the evidence, not public passions.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 While Mosby has been praised for charging the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  involved in the April 12 arrest of Gray -- who died a week later from spinal injuries sustained in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  custody -- some legal experts say she brought charges to quell Baltimore's civil unrest rather than to seek justice.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Every \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a tragedy, but not every \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a murder or a crime," said Jason Weinstein, a criminal defense attorney and former federal prosecutor in Maryland who won a public corruption conviction against former Baltimore \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Commissioner Edward Norris in 2004. "Whether you have a badge or not, if there is sufficient evidence that you engaged in illegal conduct, you should be prosecuted.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "But if there's not sufficient evidence, then you shouldn't be prosecuted. That should be the only question. It shouldn't be how much coverage there is on CNN or if there were riots."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The city's rare cases
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The last Baltimore \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  charged with an on-duty killing was Tommy Sanders in 2008. Sanders shot an unarmed 27-year-old in the back as the man fled from the Hamilton Park Shopping Center. A jury acquitted Sanders of manslaughter after he said the man, Edward Lamont Hunt, reached into a pocket, making him fear for his life.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Years earlier, Stephen Pagotto was charged with manslaughter in the 1996 shooting \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of a 22-year-old man during a traffic stop in Northeast Baltimore. Pagotto was convicted, but the verdict was overturned on appeal.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Pagotto said the shooting was an accident caused when his gun discharged accidentally, and the state's highest court ruled he was not criminally responsible. But the court noted that the sergeant violated departmental rules, which amounted to "civil negligence," and the city paid $100,000 to settle a lawsuit filed by the family of the driver, Preston Barnes.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In such settlements, the city and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  do not acknowledge liability for a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Charges against three other \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 deaths\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of suspects between 1983 and 1994 ended in a mistrial and two acquittals.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The only other \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to be convicted of manslaughter in the past 30 years was Gahiji Tshamba, who was off duty when he shot and killed Tyrone Brown in a fight outside a nightclub in 2010. He was sentenced to 15 years, and the city paid a settlement in the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  because Brown's lawyer argued that Tshamba had claimed to be making an off-duty arrest.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Such cases, though, are exceptions. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rarely are charged, let alone convicted, in arrest-related \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 deaths.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But just how rare it is can be hard to quantify because not all law enforcement agencies keep track of the number of people killed in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  encounters, and there is some variability in the way states collect data. Over the three decades, at least 120 people have died in encounters with Baltimore \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  according to city statistics and news reports.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The federal Bureau of Justice Statistics concluded in March that its tally of arrest-related \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 deaths\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  likely captures half, at best, of the actual number of incidents. Nationwide from 2003 to 2009, the most recent statistics available, 4,813 arrest-related \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 deaths\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were reported to the agency. Nearly 3,000 of them were classified as homicides by law enforcement; others include people who committed suicide when an \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  responded to a 911 call, or who sped away from a traffic stop and crashed. Detainees also have died from drug overdoses and other health problems while in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  custody.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A bill signed into law by Gov. Larry Hogan on Tuesday requires law enforcement agencies to report to the state the number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -involved \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 deaths,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as well as any \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  killed in the line of duty.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Governor's Office of Crime Control and Prevention will start collecting the data in July and issue a report in October 2016 that will cover the three previous years, said Gregory Coster, who directs the office's Maryland Statistical Analysis Center. He said Maryland was already reporting \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 deaths\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to the Bureau of Justice Statistics on a voluntary basis, but the new law makes it mandatory for local \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  departments to provide information to the state.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I think any time you have a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  custody, it's something state and local government and the community needs to know about," said Christopher Shank, the former state senator who now directs the crime control office.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 'I try to make him proud'
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Shean D. Camper is among the rarities. A grand jury indicted him for manslaughter in the shooting \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of Jerrod D. Wagstaff, 25, in a dark alley off the 2700 block of Tivoly Ave. on May 6, 1994.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I'm gone, man, I'm gone," Andre Flood, now 44, remembers his brother saying as he lay wounded that night.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Flood and his mother returned this week to their former block, one of Baltimore's most notoriously criminal and tragic. After years of contending with the blight and drug trafficking in that part of Northeast Baltimore, the city in 2008 began leveling the block for a multimillion-dollar redevelopment project.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But two bedraggled rowhouses remain on one stretch of the street: 2783, where the Floods lived, and 2781, where 10 people perished in a 1982 fire that remains among the most deadly in city history.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I come down every once in a while just to look," Diane Flood said as a giant earth-moving machine rumbled over a pile of bricks a couple of lots down.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The night of the shooting remains vivid to the Floods 21 years later: \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  arrived to investigate reports of gunfire in the area, and Camper said Wagstaff began running, prompting a chase. Stories diverge at this point: Camper said the two scuffled, and he fired when Wagstaff took a threatening stance. Witnesses said Wagstaff was climbing over a fence when he was shot.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The medical examiner's report said Wagstaff had puncture marks on his left hand from scaling the fence, and a bullet fired by Camper shattered against the fence, with a fragment striking Wagstaff.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A witness at the time said she heard Wagstaff call for his mother, a medical assistant. But Andre Flood said \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevented her from getting to him and possibly rendering aid. Diane Flood said she rode in the ambulance with her unconscious son to Johns Hopkins Hospital, where a doctor she worked with was among those who tried to save him.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Camper went to trial in March 1995 and was found not guilty. He and his attorney did not respond to requests for comment.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I felt as though he had gotten away with shooting my son," said Diane Flood, now retired. She filed a wrongful-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  suit against Camper, hoping that Wagstaff's son, then 2, would have money for college.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Before that civil suit could come to trial, Camper, while off duty, was involved in a traffic dispute in which the other driver stopped, got out and struck him with a baseball bat. Camper shot and critically wounded the man, and the shooting was ruled justified.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A jury ultimately awarded Wagstaff's family $111,000. The award was later revised, and Flood said that after lawyers' fees, she and her grandson each received about $33,000.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Wagstaff's son, Brian Daniels, now 23, said his grandmother's wishes were fulfilled -- some of the settlement allowed him to attend community college and Morgan State University. He now works seven days a week -- Monday through Friday in help-desk support for TEKsystems, which was founded by Ravens owner Steve Bisciotti, and on weekends at a YMCA.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 No amount of money, though, can replace his loss, he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I don't have a memory of my dad. I didn't have him at my games, at graduation, at birthday parties," said Daniels, who played football and lacrosse at Dunbar High School. "But I try to make him proud."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Daniels credits his family, especially his grandmother Diane and uncle Andre, who is a truck driver and coach, with raising him to respect \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . And in fact, he said, he has applied to join the Anne Arundel \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Department.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A 'difficult' standard
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The details of a 1994 incident are eerily familiar: A man is arrested in Sandtown-Winchester and placed in a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  transport van, where he is later found unconscious.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  said Jesse Chapman, 30, followed his girlfriend into the Western District \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  station late that night, where she'd gone to complain that he had beaten her. There, he tried to hit her, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  said, and when \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  tried to intervene, he ran. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  chased and caught him.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  triggered days of protests, with more than 100 demonstrators converging on the Western District station at times.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The medical examiner's office said Chapman's heart-lung system collapsed under stress from cocaine use, an asthma attack and a struggle with arresting \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and there was no evidence of repeated blows or significant injuries. A grand jury declined to indict the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  involved.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 While most \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  who have been involved in arrest-related \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 deaths\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  declined to comment for this article or did not respond to requests, one former \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  did defend his actions.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Charles M. Smothers shot a knife-wielding man outside Lexington Market in August 1997, an incident that was videotaped by a bystander and sparked community protests. But he rejected comparisons to the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of Freddie Gray.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "My case is totally different," Smothers said. "I shot an \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed suspect\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The videotape of the shooting showed four \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  with their guns drawn approaching James Quarles III, who had been using a knife to open a package of socks he was hawking on the street. They ordered the 22-year-old, who was hunched with both hands close to the ground, to drop the knife, and when he failed to do so, Smothers shot him.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Then-state's attorney Jessamy decided not to present the case to a grand jury because she could "find no evidence of a crime."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Smothers' career was changed anyway. As a result of the shooting, a previous domestic violence incident became more widely known and then-Commissioner Thomas C. Frazier fired him. Smothers had been charged with shooting at an ex-girlfriend and her new boyfriend in April 1995 -- the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  said his gun went off accidentally -- and he received probation before judgment.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "As a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , I did my job," said Smothers, who has joined the Fire Department. "The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Department turned their back on me."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 When \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are accused of shooting someone, they often testify that they feared for their life.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 That's no accident. The Supreme Court case of Graham v. Connor established the reasonableness standard for judging \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  who shoot people. Prosecutors and juries are required to consider the actions by putting themselves into the decisive moment when a gun was used, based on the specific facts and circumstances of each incident.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 If \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  say they feared for their lives when they killed someone, it's hard to refute that assertion without other credible evidence, said Ron Hosko, a former assistant FBI director and president of the Law Enforcement Legal Defense Fund.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 That's for good reason, said Jim Pasco, executive director of the National Fraternal Order of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  "What would seem to be the most routine of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  activities -- a traffic stop and a call for a domestic incident -- are ironically the most dangerous," he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A New York City \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and two \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Mississippi died this month from gunshot wounds suffered in traffic stops.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Often they come on a scene when an event is in progress, and they have to make a split-second decision about what action to take," Pasco said. "These actions are subject to endless second-guessing."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But that frustrates attorneys like Pettit.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "That's the boilerplate, standard defense: 'I thought I saw a gun, I thought my life was in jeopardy and I reacted,' " he said. "The Supreme Court doesn't allow you to second-guess the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and their other options. The law makes it very difficult to try these cases."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 'An ugly situation'
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Critics say other factors add to the difficulty of bringing charges against \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  who are involved in a suspect's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  often protect one another in such situations, said attorney William H. "Billy" Murphy Jr., who represents Gray's family. "That's dishonorable. You have a nation that institutionally the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are believed over anybody black and over most citizens."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In addition, Murphy said prosecutors struggle to bring charges against \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  they work with routinely.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Philip Stinson, a criminologist at Bowling Green State University who has studied \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  misconduct cases, said it's always a challenge to convict \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Nobody wants to see a cop go to prison," Stinson said. "It's an ugly situation."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But he said the Gray case might be easier to win than a typical case of a questionable \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shooting.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Juries are very reluctant to second-guess \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  -- especially in life-and-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  situations," he said. But in the Gray case, Stinson said, it would be difficult to convince a jury that the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were in any danger.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The facts are still not clear, said Hosko of the Law Enforcement Legal Defense Fund. While Mosby alleges that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ignored Gray's requests for medical care and placed him in a transport van without securing him in a seat belt -- violations of department policy -- Hosko notes that many detainees fake injuries to avoid going to jail. Some \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  do not place seat belts on suspects who are acting violently, he added.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mosby has a long way to go to prove that the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  had any criminal intent in how they treated Gray, he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But Hosko said it is possible that one or more \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Gray's arrest might deserve to be criminally charged.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Are there people who shouldn't be in law enforcement? Absolutely. Good leadership should run them off. But you have a lot of folks out there who got into law enforcement to be public servants and to ensure others' safety at their own risk," Hosko said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But Tawanda Jones, whose brother died in a scuffle with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is among those encouraged by Mosby's stance.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Jones said a prosecutor's decision not to pursue charges in the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of her brother Tyrone West drove her family to hold protests since he died on July 18, 2013.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The state's attorney's office said that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were legally justified in using fists, batons and pepper spray to subdue West, who resisted arrest after a traffic stop. He died as \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  pinned him on the ground.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The medical examiner's office found that West died of a heart problem made worse by dehydration, the July heat and his struggle with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  The autopsy report said West did not suffer any injuries that could have killed him, but the medical examiner could not determine whether the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  resulted from an accident, homicide or another means.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Jones said then-state's attorney Bernstein did meet with the family to explain he would not be indicting any \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  "He had the nerve to have us escorted out by a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ," she said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 She still is upset about Bernstein's decision, and recently voiced allegations of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  brutality to U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch during Lynch's Baltimore visit. The Justice Department later announced a broad civil rights investigation of Baltimore's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Jones said Mosby has lived up to a campaign promise to prosecute \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  for misconduct.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I'm pleased that [Mosby] kept her word true to what she said she will do to handle \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  brutality," Jones said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Greta Carter-Willis -- who watched an \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shoot and kill her 14-year-old son in her Southwest Baltimore rowhouse -- also is encouraged by Mosby's decision to charge the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Gray's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 On Aug. 12, 2006, Carter-Willis called \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to calm her son, Kevin Cooper, because the two were arguing. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  said the boy was assaulting his mother, who has always denied that. After two \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  responded and calmed the boy, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Roderick Mitter stayed to write a report while the other \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  left.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  said Mitter and the boy continued to argue, and the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  sprayed him with Mace to no effect. The boy then hit Mitter with a broom handle, which broke, and came at the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  with the jagged broken end, according to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  That's when Mitter shot him in the shoulder.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Carter-Willis, 52, a retired state correctional \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  disputes the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  account.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Pettit filed a lawsuit for wrongful \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  but the family lost.

\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 May 22--A Sampson County \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 sheriff's deputy\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  who shot and killed an \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  robbery \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suspect\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  last month was justified in his actions due to the apparent danger posed by the man, who wielded a shotgun as he approached the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 deputies,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  District Attorney Ernie Lee said Thursday.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 On April 12, Jason Lee Evans, 32, of Harrells, was fatally shot by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Sheriff's Deputy\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Louis M. High Jr. following a robbery in Garland that extended into a high-speed car chase and subsequent shooting on N.C. 242 near Salemburg.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "After reviewing the investigation with the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation, it is clear that Evans' \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  while tragic, was justified because Evans' actions caused \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Deputy\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  High to reasonably believe it necessary to use deadly force to protect the lives of (himself) and Sgt. Edward Vann," Lee said in a lengthy statement released Thursday. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In the release, the district attorney lays out the evidence in the case and the details of the investigation that occurred in the weeks that followed.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The investigation revealed that prior to the shooting, Evans had committed a robbery of the Han-Dee Hugo's convenience store located at 19 N. Ingold Ave., Garland, was armed with an illegally sawed-off single barrel 410 Revelation shotgun, fired the shotgun at the Han-Dee Hugo's and engaged in a high-speed chase traveling in excess of 100 mph from Garland to near Roseboro.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 After using stop sticks to cause Evans to stop his vehicle on N.C. 242 between Reeda Branch Road and Corinth Church Road, Evans exited his vehicle in the presence of two \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 deputies,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  High and Vann, with his sawed-off shotgun. Vann warned Evans to drop his shotgun but Evans kept the shotgun in his right hand toward his own head and refused to follow the commands of law enforcement to put the shotgun down. High fired his law enforcement issued 9 mm handgun, hitting Evans four times.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Although tragic that a life was lost, the shooting \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of Evans is found to be justified to protect the safety and lives of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Deputy\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  High and Sgt. Vann from potential harm as perceived by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Deputy\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  High," Lee stated.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 deputy\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was placed on paid administrative leave pending the investigation. The SBI dispatched agents to N.C. 242 to investigate the shooting. Lee kept in close contact with SBI Special Agent Bradley Williams, the lead investigator in the case, throughout the probe.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 On May 8, Lee said he viewed the video of the armed robbery at the Han-Dee Hugo's as well as the footage from a video camera mounted on Vann's vehicle that captured the high-speed chase and subsequent shooting.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Video footage shows that at about 11:30 p.m., as Evans entered the convenience store he fired one shot from his shotgun into the ceiling and told the two clerks he wanted the registers emptied. Evans reloaded the shotgun while in the store and obtained money during the robbery. At 11:32 p.m., one of the clerks was able to activate the silent alarm, dispatching \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 deputies\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to the store minutes later. The exterior video camera system at the convenience store shows Evans leaving the store in a white four-door Chevrolet Malibu.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 At approximately 11:41 p.m., Vann observed the Malibu on N.C. 411 and began his pursuit, reaching speeds in excess of 100 mph. Moments later, High placed stop sticks in the highway in an attempt to stop the Malibu. The vehicle struck the stop sticks and eventually one of his tires began to shred. High and Vann continued their pursuit of Evans, who was seen reaching into his backseat by Vann.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The tire on Evans' vehicle continued to shred and he was eventually riding on the exposed rim, at which point he finally stopped between Reeda Branch Road and Corinth Church Road, approximately 20 miles from the convenience store in Garland.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Vann's in-car camera video shows Evans exiting his vehicle with his shotgun in his right hand. Vann repeatedly yelled at Evans to put the weapon down and he continued to move away from his car and in the direction of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 deputies,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Lee stated. He inched closer to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 deputies\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  with the shotgun to his head, never firing the weapon.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In a statement made to the SBI, High gave an account consistent with the video recording of the pursuit and the shooting, Lee noted. He said he felt threatened by Evans as the man moved from the Malibu and in a direction towards the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 deputies.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 At approximately 11:49 p.m., Lee said, High fired his Sig Sauer P226 9mm service handgun at Evans, firing six rounds in total and striking Evans four times. Vann pulled his service handgun but did not fire his weapon. Evans was killed at the scene. The sawed-off shotgun was found next to Evans, loaded with one shotgun shell.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Medical Examiner Dr. Carl Barr, who conducted an autopsy on Evans, confirmed four gunshot wounds, one grazing Evans' right forearm and another that went through his left arm, neither of which were life-threatening. The other two gunshot wounds were to Evans' neck and his head, which was lethal, Barr said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Lee cited N.C. General Statute 15A-401, which states that when making an arrest a law enforcement officer is justified in using deadly physical force upon another person to defend himself or a third person from what he reasonably believes to be the use or imminent use of deadly physical force. Additionally, he said, general rules of self-defense and defense of others in North Carolina allow for the use of deadly force when the individual actually, or honestly, believed in the need to defend himself or others from \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  or great bodily injury, the District attorney said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Clearly, from the facts and circumstances of this case, the officer was justified in using deadly force to defend himself and others from \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  or great bodily injury," Lee remarked. "Law enforcement officers are required to instantaneously evaluate and employ force against possible criminal suspects to thwart apparent dangers to citizens and themselves. Officers must perceive, evaluate, decide and then act often in a matter of seconds. The perceived danger to the officer must be only apparent, not actual, in order to justify use of deadly force."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Although there is evidence of actual danger to High, under the law there was also apparent danger as perceived by him, Lee stated. From the evidence, he noted, it "reasonably appeared" to High there was sufficient basis for self-defense and defense of third persons, his fellow \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 deputy.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Based upon my review of the facts of this case, I have determined that the shooting of Jason Lee Evans on April 12, 2015 was justified to protect the safety and lives of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Deputy\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  High and Sgt. Vann as the threat appeared to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Deputy\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  High," Lee said. "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Deputy\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  High perceived an apparent threat, evaluated the situation in split seconds, made a decision and acted. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Deputy\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  High's actions appear reasonable under all the circumstances of this case."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 From all the evidence, High initially exercised restraint in the face of imminent danger as Evans exited his vehicle with a loaded weapon in a manner that could reasonably be deemed as threatening, the district attorney.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "As tragic as this incident is with the loss of life, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Deputy\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  High nonetheless was justified in defending himself from \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  or great bodily injury and in defending the life of fellow officer, Sgt. Vann," Lee concluded. "There is insufficient evidence beyond a reasonable doubt to show that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Deputy\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  High acted in a manner that was not consistent with his perception of an apparent threat."

\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  BODY:
\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A new report shows that US \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have shot and killed 385 people during the first five months of 2015, an average of more than two \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 fatal\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shootings a day. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate is over twice the account tallied by the federal government during the past 10 years, which officials admit is incomplete, according to a Washington Post analysis published on Saturday.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "These shootings are grossly under\-reported," said Jim Bueermann, a former \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  chief and president of the Washington-based \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Foundation, a nonprofit organization which works to improve law enforcement.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We are never going to reduce the number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shootings if we don't begin to accurately track this information," Bueermann was quoted by The Post as saying.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The analysis is the result of information The Post is compiling on every \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 fatal\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shooting by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in 2015 in addition to data of every \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  killed by gunfire in the line of duty.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The data is related to shootings and does not include killings by other means, such as stun guns and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 deaths\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  custody.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The study shows that almost half the victims were minority. However, the demographics shifted markedly among the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 unarmed\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 victims,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  with two-thirds being African American or Hispanic.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 On the whole, US \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  killed blacks at three times the rate of whites or other minorities when adjusting by the population of the census tracts, where the shootings took place.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Los Angeles \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Department engages in an altercation that ended in the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of a homeless man on March 1, 2015.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A large proportion of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 victims,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  over 80 percent, were \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  with objects, including guns, knives, machetes, revving vehicles and, in one case, a nail gun.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 49 people were not armed with any weapons, while the guns used by 13 others were not real. Overall, 16 percent were either carrying a toy or were unarmed, according to The Post.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Several current and former \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  chiefs and other criminal justice officials said it was time \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  accepted responsibility for the bloodshed. They argued that a vast majority of the killings, examined by The Post, resulted from poor policing.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We have to get beyond what is legal and start focusing on what is preventable. Most are preventable," said Ronald L. Davis, a former \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  chief, who heads the Justice Department's Office of Community Oriented Policing Services.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  "need to stop chasing down suspects, hopping fences and landing on top of someone with a gun," Davis said. "When they do that, they have no choice but to shoot."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The report came as many US cities have been the scene of protests over the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 deaths\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of several unarmed African Americans by white \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and decisions by grand juries not to indict the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Another analysis by The Post and researchers at Bowling Green State University, released last week, showed that only 54 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have been charged for thousands of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 fatal\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shootings at the hands of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  across the United States over the past decade.

\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 On the day the Dane County district attorney announced he would not file charges against the white Madison \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  who shot and killed an unarmed, black 19-year-old, Madison's leading civil rights organization posed this hypothetical: "(W)e believe it is a legitimate question to ask whether the outcome of this encounter would have been different had Tony Robinson been a white, middle-class teen engaged in similar behavior," the Urban League of Greater Madison said in a statement.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It is a legitimate question, and based on the details of other recent, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 fatal\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Madison \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shootings, the answer is: "no, probably not." 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Since what can fairly be described in a city the size of Madison as a spate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 fatal\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shootings that began in November 2012, four of six \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 victims\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have been white and one of the white \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 victims was also unarmed\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . No \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were charged in the incidents.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Londrell Johnson, 33, was black and was fatally shot by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  on May 2, 2014, after he stabbed three people, two of them to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Johnson had a long history of mental illness.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Only three months apart in 2013, Brent Brozek, 43, and Charles Carll, 59, both white, were killed by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Brozek had mental health problems and had come at \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  with a sword outside his condo, and Carll had advanced on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  with a knife in his backyard, according to investigators.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Paul Heenan, 30, was killed on Nov. 9, 2012, in the front yard of an East Side home after being reported as a possible burglary \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suspect\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Heenan, who was white, was \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 unarmed\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  but intoxicated and allegedly reached for the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  gun during a struggle.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In what I've always thought was the least justified killing of the six, a 26-year-old white woman, Ashley DiPiazza, was shot and killed by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  a year ago Monday after she refused orders to drop a gun ? which she was pointing at her own head.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 No one else was in the apartment where the DiPiazza shooting occurred, and nearby apartments were evacuated ? so it's unlikely DiPiazza would have been able to put anyone else in danger. Instead of setting up a perimeter outside the building, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  entered the apartment.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 When about 30 minutes' worth of trying to talk her down failed, she walked out of a bedroom toward the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  who shot her.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Ruben Anthony, president and CEO of the Urban League, said the Robinson killing and the other killings are "not comparable situations."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "In all but the Heenan situation, the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suspect\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 " he said. "According to the DA's findings (on Tuesday), the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was informed Tony was unarmed." That is an important detail, but then so are lots of details.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Heenan, the unarmed white man, for example, wasn't reported to be "acting insane" and on hallucinogenic mushrooms.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He wasn't a suspect in three assaults and possibly engaged in a fourth when \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  arrived. He didn't ambush and strike an \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the head from the top of a 4-foot-wide stairway.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Those are all things Robinson did or was suspected of doing in the minutes before he was killed, according to the state's investigation.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Study after study after study has shown that African- Americans face more severe outcomes when they come into contact with law enforcement," Anthony noted.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 That's true, and if all that were needed to determine a specific \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  culpability in a specific \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shooting were studies, there would be no need for investigations of the details of a specific \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  culpability in a specific \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shooting.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Of course, we all pay attention to different details, sometimes because those are the most important details to pay attention to and sometimes because those are the details we prefer or need ? for a variety of reasons ? to pay attention to.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 With the possible exception of Johnson, none of the six people Madison \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have shot and killed since November 2012 did anything in the moments before they died that was deserving of their fate.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But they all had life circumstances and made decisions that made it more likely for them to be involved in the kinds of violent encounters with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  that can end in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Neither are any of their stories any more tragic than any of the others ? or any less of a reason for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and the public to constantly be reviewing and improving \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  procedures.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 That Robinson's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  can look like another suspicious killing of an \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 unarmed\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  black \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suspect\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  doesn't mean that it is.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nor does it make Madison \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  the same as \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Ferguson, Missouri, or New York City or Baltimore.

\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  BODY:
\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Michael Brelo, a white Cleveland \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  indicted for jumping on a car hood to fire a deadly volley of gunfire at two unarmed motorists in 2012, has been found not guilty by a county judge in Ohio, reiterating the complex dynamics that make it hard to find \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  guilty of crimes committed as they carry out their duty.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 deaths\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of Timothy Russell and Malissa Williams, both black, were included as a point of criticism in a 2014 US Department of Justice report that called for a federal monitor to oversee the Cleveland \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Department. The not guilty verdict  on Saturday comes amid heightened scrutiny and protest around \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shooting \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 deaths,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  including the looming outcome of an investigation into the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of 12-year-old Tamir Rice by two Cleveland \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in November. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The verdict also came on a day that saw more protests in Olympia, Wash., where a white \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  on Thursday shot two black skateboarders after they allegedly shoplifted beer. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  say the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was attacked by the two young men before he fired. Both men are expected to survive.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Given the dynamics of the 2012 shooting, the verdict reflects in part the difficulty of prosecuting \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  for heat of the moment decisions. Last year, two grand juries - one in Ferguson, Mo., the other in Staten Island - declined to return criminal charges against \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  involved in the killing of unarmed black men. Protests and riots have followed such acquittals. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This week, a Baltimore grand jury indicted six \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  for their alleged roles in the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of a black man named Freddie Gray. Mr. Gray's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  caused two separate spasms of localized riots in Baltimore before the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were charged.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr. Brelo, the Cleveland \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was indicted for voluntary manslaughter for jumping on the hood of a car that had been under \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  fire and shooting repeatedly down into the windshield. Whether any of Brelo's 15 fired bullets were the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 fatal\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  blows was a key question in the trial, given that each victim received over 20 bullet wounds a piece.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Cuyahoga County Judge John P. O'Donnell also determined that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Brelo was not guilty of two lesser-included counts of felonious assault.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In a nod to wide legal latitude given to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in dangerous situations, Judge O'Donnell found that Brelo, in the heat of the moment, reasonably perceived a threat from the two motorists. He, however, "ran afoul of the Constitution" when he got on top of the car, since that's a tactic that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are not trained to do, Mr. O'Donnell noted. Brelo could still face other charges for his actions.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 O'Donnell also said that while forensics showed that Ms. Williams received at least one \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 fatal\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shot from Brelo's gun, he couldn't determine whether the other \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 fatal\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shots also came from Brelo. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  fired a total of 137 shots at the motorists after Russell's 1979 Chevy Malibu backfired in front of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  headquarters, sparking a dramatic chase. Brelo's actions came after the Malibu had come to a stop. Neither of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 victims was armed.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Justice Department report, which was in part sparked by the Brelo case, determined late last year that Cleveland \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  had for years been engaged in a pattern of using excessive force against citizens and violating people's civil rights in other ways.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It's not clear how people will react to the verdict. Protests against \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  brutality have roiled the US since the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., last year. The Monitor reported on Saturday that the "hands up, don't shoot" movement has been used by protesters as far away as Jordan.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Judge O'Donnell decided to read the verdict on Saturday to reduce the risk of protests. The judge said he was well aware of the tensions around allegations of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  brutality and a sense among many Americans that there's not enough justice for unarmed people killed by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . O'Donnell specifically cited the Tamir Rice case as he read his verdict.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Every week, I pass a mountain of stuffed animals left in memory of a 12-year-old that many people believe was murdered by the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 " he said.

\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Montgomery County \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Sheriff\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Ladson O'Connor was killed early Tuesday when he crashed while pursuing an \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed suspect\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , the Georgia Bureau of Investigation said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The suspect later surrendered after exchanging gunfire with authorities. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 GBI spokeswoman Sherry Lang said the incident began around midnight in Toombs County, a rural community about three hours southeast of Atlanta. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Deputies\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  there were assisting a motorist when the driver of another vehicle --- believed to be 35-year-old Jim Edward Lowery --- "attempted to leave the area" after spotting them, Lang said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 That piqued the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 deputies'\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  interest and they attempted to initiate a traffic stop. Lowery fled, authorities said, and O'Connor joined in the chase when it continued on Ga. 56 into nearby Montgomery County.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "During the pursuit, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Sheriff\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  O'Connor lost control of his vehicle, wrecked and was dead on the scene," Lang said. Montgomery County is about two hours southeast of Atlanta in southeast Georgia.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 What may have led O'Connor to lose control was unclear, though Lang said either Lowery or 36-year-old passenger Nicole Dixie Best fired shots at \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  during the chase. An autopsy was being performed at the GBI's crime lab in Savannah, Lang said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The chase ended near the town of Uvalda, where state troopers had placed "stop sticks" on the road, Lang said. Lowery crashed his vehicle and managed to escape --- for a few hours, at least.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 At about 9:30 a.m. Tuesday, Georgia State Patrol SWAT team members located Lowery in McNatt Falls, a town in Montgomery County. Lowery surrendered after an exchange of gunfire.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Lowery had sustained an injury to his leg but it is unknown at this time if the injury is a result of the shooting or if it occurred while he was on the run from law enforcement," Lang said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Lowery was arrested and charged with three counts of aggravated assault on a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and one count of fleeing and attempting to elude a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Best, the passenger in his vehicle, was also detained and "is being held in the Montgomery County jail while warrants are being obtained for her arrest," Lang said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It was unclear what charges Best will face.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The GBI is investigating both the chase and the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -involved shooting that occurred during Lowery's apprehension, Lang said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 O'Connor, 42, had served as the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 sheriff\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of Montgomery County since January 2013. He leaves behind a wife and four children.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Messages left with the Montgomery County \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Sheriff's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Office on Tuesday were not immediately returned. Several metro Atlanta agencies took to social media Tuesday to express their condolences.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Our thoughts and prayers are with the family of Montgomery County \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Sheriff\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Ladson O'Connor and with the Montgomery County \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Sheriff's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Office," the Gwinnett County \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Sheriff's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Office wrote on Facebook.

\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Montgomery County \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Sheriff\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Ladson O'Connor was killed early Tuesday when he crashed while pursuing an \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed suspect\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , the Georgia Bureau of Investigation said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The suspect later surrendered after exchanging gunfire with authorities. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 GBI spokeswoman Sherry Lang said the incident began around midnight in Toombs County, a rural community about three hours southeast of Atlanta. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Deputies\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  there were assisting a motorist when the driver of another vehicle --- believed to be 35-year-old Jim Edward Lowery --- "attempted to leave the area" after spotting them, Lang said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 That piqued the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 deputies'\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  interest and they attempted to initiate a traffic stop. Lowery fled, authorities said, and O'Connor joined in the chase when it continued on Ga. 56 into nearby Montgomery County.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "During the pursuit, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Sheriff\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  O'Connor lost control of his vehicle, wrecked and was dead on the scene," Lang said. Montgomery County is about two hours southeast of Atlanta in southeast Georgia.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 What may have led O'Connor to lose control was unclear, though Lang said either Lowery or 36-year-old passenger Nicole Dixie Best fired shots at \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  during the chase. An autopsy was being performed at the GBI's crime lab in Savannah, Lang said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The chase ended near the town of Uvalda, where state troopers had placed "stop sticks" on the road, Lang said. Lowery crashed his vehicle and managed to escape --- for a few hours, at least.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 At about 9:30 a.m. Tuesday, Georgia State Patrol SWAT team members located Lowery in McNatt Falls, a town in Montgomery County. Lowery surrendered after an exchange of gunfire.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Lowery had sustained an injury to his leg but it is unknown at this time if the injury is a result of the shooting or if it occurred while he was on the run from law enforcement," Lang said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Lowery was arrested and charged with three counts of aggravated assault on a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and one count of fleeing and attempting to elude a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Best, the passenger in his vehicle, was also detained and "is being held in the Montgomery County jail while warrants are being obtained for her arrest," Lang said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It was unclear what charges Best will face.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The GBI is investigating both the chase and the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -involved shooting that occurred during Lowery's apprehension, Lang said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 O'Connor, 42, had served as the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 sheriff\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of Montgomery County since January 2013. He leaves behind a wife and four children.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Messages left with the Montgomery County \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Sheriff's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Office on Tuesday were not immediately returned. Several metro Atlanta agencies took to social media Tuesday to express their condolences.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Our thoughts and prayers are with the family of Montgomery County \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Sheriff\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Ladson O'Connor and with the Montgomery County \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Sheriff's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Office," the Gwinnett County \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Sheriff's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Office wrote on Facebook.

Daly and Neptune First Aid members assessed the patient, his current health situation and because paramedics were unavailable at the time, they determined the patient would have to be transported to Jersey Shore Medical Center immediately. During transport the patient had a seizure and became unresponsive, and CPR was initiated. Daly and first aid members continued CPR compressions in the ambulance for the duration of the trip to the hospital. At JSUMC, he was taken to the trauma unit where the patient regained his pulse and was listed in stable but critical condition. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Daly's assistance and relentless efforts with CPR compressions were critical in the ability to regain his pulse at JSUMC.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Detective Jason Petillo
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 On Feb. 21, 2014, patrols responded to a reported burglary in Shark River Hills. The victims indicated their house was forcibly entered, and jewelry and cash was stolen. Det. Petillo was assigned to investigate the incident. During his investigation, Det. Petillo located two pieces of jewelry believed to be the victim's at a local gold-buying establishment. The person identified as selling the jewelry was a known drug addict. In addition to collecting the suspected stolen jewelry, Det. Petillo interviewed the jeweler who recalled an unknown male who remained outside. Petillo responded to another pawn shop which revealed video of an attempt to sell items by the suspects. No sale was made, but video evidence was gathered. Neptune City \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  located one of the suspects and detained him. An interview was conducted which implicated others. Through countless searches of pawn shops and jewelry establishments in Monmouth and Ocean counties, Det. Petillo used interviews and information gathered to identify an additional subject who had some of the stolen jewelry within her possession. Approximately six suspects were eventually arrested and charged as a result of Det. Petillo's relentless efforts, with the assistance of several \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  departments: Asbury Park, Belmar, Brick, Lake Como, Neptune City and Toms River \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Department.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 On Nov. 12, 2014, Detective Chapman was driving to work on Route 33 in Freehold Township when he observed a male in his 50s clinging to the outer rail of a four story overpass. It appeared that the male was preparing to jump to his \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Detective Chapman immediately turned around, parked his vehicle and approached the male on foot. As he approached the male, the man told Detective Chapman that he had nothing to live for and he was going to kill himself. Due to Detective Chapman's narcotic training and experience, he immediately associated the male's violent trembling and shaking to be related to narcotics and/or alcohol withdrawal. Detective Chapman calmly engaged the male in conversation and convinced him that his life was worth living and not to jump. Detective Chapman called the Freehold Township \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Department while he continued to talk and comfort the male. Subsequently, the male allowed Detective Chapman to physically pull him to safety. For his effort Detective Chapman receives a merit award. Detective Chapman has requested a donation be made in his name to his favorite charity.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 During the first half of 2014, Detective Diodati and Trooper Boyd investigated a series of burglaries that occurred in the New Jersey State \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Hamilton Sub-Station patrol area. These burglaries, 19 in total, resulted in a loss to victims of approximately $190,000 worth of property. As a result of their investigation, Detective Diodati and Trooper Boyd identified two suspects who were suspected of committing not only the aforementioned burglaries, but additional burglaries in Monmouth, Ocean and Burlington counties. Their efforts resulted in the return of approximately $25,000 worth of property to its rightful owners. These efforts also solidified the case against the suspects by providing definite proof of the fact they were pawning stolen goods in multiple locations. It should be noted the suspects were still actively involved in committing burglaries at the time of their arrests. The efforts of Detective Diodati and Trooper Boyd, in addition to solving 30 total burglaries in multiple jurisdictions, prevented an untold number of crimes from occurring.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 On Nov. 14, 2014 members of the Middletown Township Fire Department were dispatched to Ocean Boulevard in the Leonardo section of Middletown on a reported structure fire with a possible entrapment. Upon arrival heavy fire was visible coming from a two-story wood frame structure involving both the first and second floors, totally blocking the front entrance door. Firefighters Jack Hueston, while conducting a 360 assessment of the scene, was advised that there was someone trapped inside the burning structure and was yelling for help. At this time Firefighters Hueston, Christian Burbank and John Waltz began to conduct a Vent-Enter-Search (VES) operation of two windows on the first floor. This was the area that had been pointed out earlier, as the last place that calls for help were coming from. After venting and clearing the two windows heavy black turbulent smoke vented from each window filling the both openings completely. Firefighters Burbank and Waltz searched the interior below each window sill from the exterior with negative results. Several seconds later the smoke condition raised slightly allowing firefighters Hueston, Burbank and Waltz to enter to conduct a search. The unconscious victim was located lying on the floor approximately 10 to 12 feet from the entry window. Firefighters Michael Chenoweth, Matthew Deickmann and James Phillips partially entered the burning structure from the window, and after several failed attempts to lift the victim out, a rescue strap was placed around the victims upper torso to provide added leverage to get the victim up and out to a safe location. After removal of the victim by rescuers, they began to administer basic life support techniques.

Daly and Neptune First Aid members assessed the patient, his current health situation and because paramedics were unavailable at the time, they determined the patient would have to be transported to Jersey Shore Medical Center immediately. During transport the patient had a seizure and became unresponsive, and CPR was initiated. Daly and first aid members continued CPR compressions in the ambulance for the duration of the trip to the hospital. At JSUMC, he was taken to the trauma unit where the patient regained his pulse and was listed in stable but critical condition. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Daly's assistance and relentless efforts with CPR compressions were critical in the ability to regain his pulse at JSUMC.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Detective Jason Petillo
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 On Feb. 21, 2014, patrols responded to a reported burglary in Shark River Hills. The victims indicated their house was forcibly entered, and jewelry and cash was stolen. Det. Petillo was assigned to investigate the incident. During his investigation, Det. Petillo located two pieces of jewelry believed to be the victim's at a local gold-buying establishment. The person identified as selling the jewelry was a known drug addict. In addition to collecting the suspected stolen jewelry, Det. Petillo interviewed the jeweler who recalled an unknown male who remained outside. Petillo responded to another pawn shop which revealed video of an attempt to sell items by the suspects. No sale was made, but video evidence was gathered. Neptune City \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  located one of the suspects and detained him. An interview was conducted which implicated others. Through countless searches of pawn shops and jewelry establishments in Monmouth and Ocean counties, Det. Petillo used interviews and information gathered to identify an additional subject who had some of the stolen jewelry within her possession. Approximately six suspects were eventually arrested and charged as a result of Det. Petillo's relentless efforts, with the assistance of several \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  departments: Asbury Park, Belmar, Brick, Lake Como, Neptune City and Toms River \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Department.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 On Nov. 12, 2014, Detective Chapman was driving to work on Route 33 in Freehold Township when he observed a male in his 50s clinging to the outer rail of a four story overpass. It appeared that the male was preparing to jump to his \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Detective Chapman immediately turned around, parked his vehicle and approached the male on foot. As he approached the male, the man told Detective Chapman that he had nothing to live for and he was going to kill himself. Due to Detective Chapman's narcotic training and experience, he immediately associated the male's violent trembling and shaking to be related to narcotics and/or alcohol withdrawal. Detective Chapman calmly engaged the male in conversation and convinced him that his life was worth living and not to jump. Detective Chapman called the Freehold Township \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Department while he continued to talk and comfort the male. Subsequently, the male allowed Detective Chapman to physically pull him to safety. For his effort Detective Chapman receives a merit award. Detective Chapman has requested a donation be made in his name to his favorite charity.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 During the first half of 2014, Detective Diodati and Trooper Boyd investigated a series of burglaries that occurred in the New Jersey State \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Hamilton Sub-Station patrol area. These burglaries, 19 in total, resulted in a loss to victims of approximately $190,000 worth of property. As a result of their investigation, Detective Diodati and Trooper Boyd identified two suspects who were suspected of committing not only the aforementioned burglaries, but additional burglaries in Monmouth, Ocean and Burlington counties. Their efforts resulted in the return of approximately $25,000 worth of property to its rightful owners. These efforts also solidified the case against the suspects by providing definite proof of the fact they were pawning stolen goods in multiple locations. It should be noted the suspects were still actively involved in committing burglaries at the time of their arrests. The efforts of Detective Diodati and Trooper Boyd, in addition to solving 30 total burglaries in multiple jurisdictions, prevented an untold number of crimes from occurring.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 On Nov. 14, 2014 members of the Middletown Township Fire Department were dispatched to Ocean Boulevard in the Leonardo section of Middletown on a reported structure fire with a possible entrapment. Upon arrival heavy fire was visible coming from a two-story wood frame structure involving both the first and second floors, totally blocking the front entrance door. Firefighters Jack Hueston, while conducting a 360 assessment of the scene, was advised that there was someone trapped inside the burning structure and was yelling for help. At this time Firefighters Hueston, Christian Burbank and John Waltz began to conduct a Vent-Enter-Search (VES) operation of two windows on the first floor. This was the area that had been pointed out earlier, as the last place that calls for help were coming from. After venting and clearing the two windows heavy black turbulent smoke vented from each window filling the both openings completely. Firefighters Burbank and Waltz searched the interior below each window sill from the exterior with negative results. Several seconds later the smoke condition raised slightly allowing firefighters Hueston, Burbank and Waltz to enter to conduct a search. The unconscious victim was located lying on the floor approximately 10 to 12 feet from the entry window. Firefighters Michael Chenoweth, Matthew Deickmann and James Phillips partially entered the burning structure from the window, and after several failed attempts to lift the victim out, a rescue strap was placed around the victims upper torso to provide added leverage to get the victim up and out to a safe location. After removal of the victim by rescuers, they began to administer basic life support techniques.

\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The mortally wounded Louis Anthony  Louie  Pompei led \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 deputies\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to his assailants, 20 years ago tonight.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 That deadly night, June 9, 1995, Pompei fired his gun and hit his attackers enough times that they needed emergency assistance.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Those bullets and eyewitnesses  description of the fleeing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed suspects\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0   vehicle led to the teenage killers  quick apprehension at Queen of the Valley Hospital in West Covina.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Law-enforcement agents from several jurisdictions, according to Glendora \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Chief Tim Staab, went into instant action after the wounded Pompei dialed 9-1-1 from a pay phone outside of Vons Market before collapsing. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Pompei, 30, and a 7-year veteran of the Glendora \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Department, had just gotten off duty with L.A. Impact   a regional anti-drug trafficking task force comprised of Los Angeles County \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 sheriff\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  s \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 deputies\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and municipal \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . He went to Vons Market near his San Dimas home to cash his paycheck. He was in the checkout line when two young men, later identified as Larry Hernandez, 16, and Robert Ramirez, 17, entered the store, announced a holdup and began pistol-whipping a box boy, according to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  reports.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Louie did what he was trained to do as a policeman,  Staab said.  Whether he is on- or off-duty, he was sworn to protect, serve and defend. He drew his gun and identified himself as a policeman to stop the attack on the special-needs employee. Gun fire ensued, but Louie drew fire away from customers and employees in the store and toward himself. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to a Glendora \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  memo, Pompei was hit five times, once in the upper right chest, three in the abdomen and one in the thigh.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Although the bullet that hit him in the chest was a through-and-through, it took out a ventricle to Louie s heart,  lamented the still-grieving Staab.  That just killed him. He died during surgery at San Dimas Community Hospital. Louie remains the only Glendora \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  killed in the line of duty since the department was founded in 1926.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  He remained loyal to the Law Enforcement Code of Ethics which notes, in part, that an \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  s  fundamental duty is to serve mankind, safeguard lives and property and protect the innocent against deception, the weak against oppression or intimidation and the peaceful against violence or disorder.  Louie upheld that code to the end,  Staab said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Pompei wounded the two assailants in the store before they escaped to a waiting silver Toyota Tercel. Witnesses provided a description of the car for a crime broadcast and a Pasadena \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Department helicopter used in an earlier L.A.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 That deadly night, June 9, 1995, Pompei fired his gun and hit his attackers enough times that they needed emergency assistance.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Those bullets and eyewitnesses  description of the fleeing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed suspects\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0   vehicle led to the teenage killers  quick apprehension at Queen of the Valley Hospital in West Covina.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Law-enforcement agents from several jurisdictions, according to Glendora \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Chief Tim Staab, went into instant action after the wounded Pompei dialed 9-1-1 from a pay phone outside of Vons Market before collapsing. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Pompei, 30, and a 7-year veteran of the Glendora \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Department, had just gotten off duty with L.A. Impact   a regional anti-drug trafficking task force comprised of Los Angeles County \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 sheriff\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  s \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 deputies\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and municipal \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . He went to Vons Market near his San Dimas home to cash his paycheck. He was in the checkout line when two young men, later identified as Larry Hernandez, 16, and Robert Ramirez, 17, entered the store, announced a holdup and began pistol-whipping a box boy, according to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  reports.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Louie did what he was trained to do as a policeman,  Staab said.  Whether he is on- or off-duty, he was sworn to protect, serve and defend. He drew his gun and identified himself as a policeman to stop the attack on the special-needs employee. Gun fire ensued, but Louie drew fire away from customers and employees in the store and toward himself. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to a Glendora \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  memo, Pompei was hit five times, once in the upper right chest, three in the abdomen and one in the thigh.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Although the bullet that hit him in the chest was a through-and-through, it took out a ventricle to Louie s heart,  lamented the still-grieving Staab.  That just killed him. He died during surgery at San Dimas Community Hospital. Louie remains the only Glendora \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  killed in the line of duty since the department was founded in 1926.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  He remained loyal to the Law Enforcement Code of Ethics which notes, in part, that an \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  s  fundamental duty is to serve mankind, safeguard lives and property and protect the innocent against deception, the weak against oppression or intimidation and the peaceful against violence or disorder.  Louie upheld that code to the end,  Staab said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Pompei wounded the two assailants in the store before they escaped to a waiting silver Toyota Tercel.

The seeming explosion of such cases around the country prompted me to engage my social research methods students at University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) in a project: examining trends in deadly-force incidents that have occurred here in the Baltimore/D.C. area over the last 25 years (1990 to 2015) by searching The Baltimore Sun and The Washington Post news archives for all cases in which a citizen was killed by an on-duty \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 We assumed that any such case that resulted in a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  would generate at least a brief news story, and so we set about carefully collecting and coding key pieces of information from these articles, including details such as the work shift during which the interaction happened, whether the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suspect\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  or noted to be mentally ill, and the experience level of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  who did the shooting. Students wondered if there really are more cases now than in the past due, perhaps, to more militarized styles of policing, or if the seeming increase in cases is simply a figment of the media attention. What can we learn about the patterns and themes that characterize these cases?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 No official data
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 You might be surprised, as were my students, to learn that we currently have no way of really knowing how common \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  use of lethal force against citizens actually is, as no systematic data is collected to track such incidents, despite pleas for accountability from public intellectuals right here in Baltimore like David Simon, creator of HBO's "The Wire." Unlike as with most other crime data, there is no mandatory reporting of these incidents to the FBI's Uniform Crime database. Considering how much data is compiled on each of us every day by government entities and corporations alike, it seems odd that no data at all is assembled to document these cases. Without data, it is far too easy to dismiss the magnitude or pattern of a behavior. By contrast, extensive data is collected and indexed by the FBI for each case in which a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is killed or assaulted in the line of duty.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which record and classify the manner of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  for all Americans, keep the only systematic national documentation of any kind that reports upon citizens killed by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  These are categorized as "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 deaths\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by legal intervention," and the name itself says much about how we regard such cases. Blacks (mostly males) made up 29 percent of the 159 incidents recorded in 2008 (the last year for which a report compiling this data was published), but they make up just over 13 percent of the overall American population. In 2013, a total of 27 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were feloniously killed while on duty. Given that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 deaths\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by legal intervention are four times more common than are cases of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  killed in the line of duty, shouldn't we also be collecting and tracking data for these incidents?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 When my students and I examined cases of citizens being killed by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  here in the Baltimore/DC area over the last 25 years, several interesting observations emerge:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Killings peaked in 1993
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 (1) It is a misnomer that there are more cases of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  use of deadly force now than at any point in the past.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In our data, the year with the most \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 deaths\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  (27) was 1993. There were 21 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 deaths\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in 1994, but then rates declined for several years until a spike of cases occurred 2002, when there were 20 incidents. The average number of cases per year was 10.7. It seems worth noting that community policing became very popular across this country in the mid 1990s but was then eclipsed by a more militaristic approach after 9/11.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 (2) The vast majority of cases in which \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  kill a citizen do impact black men.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Of the 262 cases we identified in which the victim's sex was reported, only 6 percent (16 cases) were women. Curiously, the race of the victim was much less frequently reported in news articles, but in the 50 cases for which the victim's race was reported, 76 percent of the dead citizens were black; 16 percent were Latino or Hispanic; 4 percent were white; and 4 percent were Asian.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In 1990, according to U.S. Census data, 39.1 percent of residents in the city of Baltimore were white. By 2000, that number had dropped to 31.6 percent -- where it remains as of 2013. In the District of Columbia, 29.6 percent of residents were white in 1990. That figure had climbed to 43.4 percent in 2013.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 So black men really are dying at a higher rate than they are represented in the broader population, very likely due to the war on drugs, which generated more scrutiny and aggressive policing of black neighborhoods. Our public policies directed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to work in this way; we must now challenge and support them to take a different approach.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 (3) Contrary to popular opinion, most victims of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shootings are not very young men.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It turns out that the average age of victims was 31.7 years, which was pretty close to the median age of 29.5. Victims in our study ranged from 2 to 78 years of age, but a relative few (6.4 percent) were under 18, and many were in their 30s and 40s.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Victims\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are usually \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 (4) In the great number of cases, the citizen was noted as having been armed.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In nearly half (48.5 percent) of the cases we examined, a gun was allegedly found on the victim. In 17.5 percent of cases, there was a knife reportedly found, and in about a quarter of cases (23.2 percent), no weapon was reported. In a small number of cases (9.3 percent), the weapon was otherwise classified (dogs, cars, umbrellas, etc.), or there were multiple weapons present (1.5 percent of cases). In 64.9 percent of cases, the citizen was noted as having been brandishing a weapon, but that leaves at least one-third of cases in which no weapon was displayed to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  And after the Walter Scott video, we have to assume that some of the weapons that were allegedly present/being brandished could have been planted or posed.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 (5) The vast majority of these incidents occurred early in an \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  career, during their second and fifth years of service.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This was one of the most interesting things we found. Of the 116 cases in which the tenure of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was known, the average number of years in service of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  who killed the citizen was 8.4 years, but the median was just six years and the mode (most common year of service noted) was just two years (15 of the 116 cases, or 12.9 percent). A full 52.6 percent of these cases occur within the first six years of an \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  service. Crossing the tenure of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  service against whether a weapon was brandished indicates negative relationship between years of service and the use of deadly force -- meaning that older \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were more likely to reserve force for cases in which the citizen/suspect pulled a weapon.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It is also quite possible that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the earlier years of service are more likely to be out patrolling streets and encountering incidents that escalate to the use of force. Perhaps \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  could be better trained early on to respond in different ways -- or to engage principles of community policing so as to reduce the general level of potential violence.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 'Dysfuntional pattern'
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The civil unrest generated by public reaction to the national spotlight being shown upon this issue should make us all wonder whether we, as a society, are capable of interracial policing. In the end, of course, we must be able to do this work in an open, just and civil manner. To reach that goal, however, we must honestly and candidly examine how we have been policing by using the sometimes-harsh mirror that objective social data provides. Most \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  interactions are respectful and professional, but a significant dysfunctional pattern exists in how white \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  interact with black suspects.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 We have seen the worst of this behavior displayed so candidly in the Walter Scott video: an \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  appearing to shoot a suspect in cold blood and then plant a weapon on the victim. These are things that black men have long told us happen more often than we want to believe. And while the video highlights a specific incident, it finally prompted an \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to be charged with murder in the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of a citizen. In Baltimore on Friday, six city \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were charged criminally in Freddie Gray's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Though the charges each received varied, all were charged with some form of assault and misconduct in office; one was charged with second-degree, depraved heart murder -- the most serious of the charges brought -- and others were charged with involuntary manslaughter.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Too often, without a video, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are exonerated via internal investigations based on rules that prioritize \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers'\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  accounts. Let's start collecting the data we need to track and systematically examine such incidents and use it to challenge and improve upon our policing until it fully reflects the integrity of our American ideal of equality under the law.

\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 GUELPH - People who knew the victim of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 fatal\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  May 20 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shooting at the Guelph General Hospital will honour him Monday with a pizza dinner.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 They will gather to remember Brandon Duncan at a downtown agency that serves local homeless and marginalized residents.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Meanwhile, local political activists are planning to protest the use of lethal weapons by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  following the shooting \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of Duncan. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Ed Pickersgill coordinates 40 Baker Street, which houses several programs and organizations that serve "the unemployed, needy and dispossessed out of poverty," according to its website. Duncan was a long-time client of Fresh Start Housing Centre, which is located at 40 Baker. Fresh Start helps the homeless find shelter and sustainable housing.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Duncan, 36, was killed in the emergency department at around 1:30 p.m. on May 20, during an interaction with two Guelph \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police officers.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  He was shot multiple times. The Special Investigations Unit has 12 investigators probing the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  The investigation is ongoing.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Duncan suffered from mental illness, addiction, and Crohn's disease, according to friends and associates in the community. He accessed services for the homeless over at least a 15 year period, and had several lengthy stays in hospital related to Crohn's. Pickersgill is dedicating the Monday pizza dinner at 40 Baker Street to Duncan. It runs from 4:15 p.m. to 5:15 p.m. People will be invited to share their thoughts and reactions on a large sheet of paper.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 On the Facebook event page for the memorial, Pickersgill states Duncan was in "a serious personal crisis resulting from homelessness, Crohn's, addiction, loneliness and fear," at the time of his \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We at 40 Baker Street would like to share our pizza day supper on Monday 1st of June in memory of Brandon Duncan so that (1) his \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  not go unmarked in his community; and (2) pizza and juice and music on that day be an occasion for those who knew him personally and for those who have shared in similar circumstances to have a chance to give a nod of understanding that his life did matter and that he simply should not have died the way he did."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Area funeral homes have been contacted and none are as yet managing memorial/burial arrangements for Duncan. The SIU would not comment this week on whether Duncan's body has been released for burial.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It's unclear where Duncan's next of kin reside. The SIU said a family member consented to release his name to the public. That person's identity has not been made public. Associates of Duncan in Guelph have asserted that they have no knowledge of him having relatives in the city. They believe he was raised in Fergus by his grandparents, who are deceased.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Monday's event at 40 Baker Street may also involve planning for a protest at an upcoming Guelph \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Services Board meeting, said Sakura Saunders.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Saunders is a local political activist, a volunteer with the Ontario Public Interest Research Group, and a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  accountability activist. She is also the founder of the group Disarm Toronto \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and advocates for the disarming of frontline \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 She said discussions are underway to organize a Guelph protest or advocacy event against the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  use of lethal force. Activists are planning to attend a Guelph \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Service public meeting at the Shelldale Centre on Tuesday. That session is an input forum related to the development of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  service's next strategic business plan.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "People are definitely disturbed about it," Saunders said, speaking of the Duncan shooting.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I have seen a number of cases (elsewhere)of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shooting people who were attempting self-harm or having mental health issues - coming in and shooting first and asking questions later," she said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 While the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 fatal\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shooting of Duncan was the first by a Guelph \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police officer,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Saunders said in the two years between August, 2011 and August, 2013, Toronto \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were engaged with 14 people who died. Seven of those were shot to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  In none of the cases, she said, were the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 victims\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as heavily \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed as the police.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "This is one of the reasons I advocate that frontline \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are disarmed, and that only a special force has lethal weapons," she said, speaking of the Duncan incident. "I think the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  should have been securing the area and making sure that people were safe, including the person they ended up killing, rather than using lethal means."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The next meeting of the Guelph \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Services Board is June 18.

\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 GUELPH - People who knew the victim of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 fatal\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  May 20 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shooting at the Guelph General Hospital will honour him Monday with a pizza dinner.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 They will gather to remember Brandon Duncan at a downtown agency that serves local homeless and marginalized residents.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Meanwhile, local political activists are planning to protest the use of lethal weapons by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  following the shooting \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of Duncan. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Ed Pickersgill coordinates 40 Baker Street, which houses several programs and organizations that serve "the unemployed, needy and dispossessed out of poverty," according to its website. Duncan was a long-time client of Fresh Start Housing Centre, which is located at 40 Baker. Fresh Start helps the homeless find shelter and sustainable housing.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Duncan, 36, was killed in the emergency department at around 1:30 p.m. on May 20, during an interaction with two Guelph \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police officers.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  He was shot multiple times. The Special Investigations Unit has 12 investigators probing the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  The investigation is ongoing.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Duncan suffered from mental illness, addiction, and Crohn's disease, according to friends and associates in the community. He accessed services for the homeless over at least a 15 year period, and had several lengthy stays in hospital related to Crohn's. Pickersgill is dedicating the Monday pizza dinner at 40 Baker Street to Duncan. It runs from 4:15 p.m. to 5:15 p.m. People will be invited to share their thoughts and reactions on a large sheet of paper.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 On the Facebook event page for the memorial, Pickersgill states Duncan was in "a serious personal crisis resulting from homelessness, Crohn's, addiction, loneliness and fear," at the time of his \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We at 40 Baker Street would like to share our pizza day supper on Monday 1st of June in memory of Brandon Duncan so that (1) his \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  not go unmarked in his community; and (2) pizza and juice and music on that day be an occasion for those who knew him personally and for those who have shared in similar circumstances to have a chance to give a nod of understanding that his life did matter and that he simply should not have died the way he did."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Area funeral homes have been contacted and none are as yet managing memorial/burial arrangements for Duncan. The SIU would not comment this week on whether Duncan's body has been released for burial.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It's unclear where Duncan's next of kin reside. The SIU said a family member consented to release his name to the public. That person's identity has not been made public. Associates of Duncan in Guelph have asserted that they have no knowledge of him having relatives in the city. They believe he was raised in Fergus by his grandparents, who are deceased.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Monday's event at 40 Baker Street may also involve planning for a protest at an upcoming Guelph \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Services Board meeting, said Sakura Saunders.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Saunders is a local political activist, a volunteer with the Ontario Public Interest Research Group, and a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  accountability activist. She is also the founder of the group Disarm Toronto \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and advocates for the disarming of frontline \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 She said discussions are underway to organize a Guelph protest or advocacy event against the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  use of lethal force. Activists are planning to attend a Guelph \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Service public meeting at the Shelldale Centre on Tuesday. That session is an input forum related to the development of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  service's next strategic business plan.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "People are definitely disturbed about it," Saunders said, speaking of the Duncan shooting.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I have seen a number of cases (elsewhere)of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shooting people who were attempting self-harm or having mental health issues - coming in and shooting first and asking questions later," she said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 While the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 fatal\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shooting of Duncan was the first by a Guelph \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police officer,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Saunders said in the two years between August, 2011 and August, 2013, Toronto \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were engaged with 14 people who died. Seven of those were shot to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  In none of the cases, she said, were the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 victims\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as heavily \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed as the police.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "This is one of the reasons I advocate that frontline \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are disarmed, and that only a special force has lethal weapons," she said, speaking of the Duncan incident. "I think the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  should have been securing the area and making sure that people were safe, including the person they ended up killing, rather than using lethal means."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The next meeting of the Guelph \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Services Board is June 18.

\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  BODY:
\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 WASHINGTON --  During a training course on defending against knife attacks, a young Salt Lake City \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  asked a question: ''How close can somebody get to me before I'm justified in using deadly force?''
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dennis Tueller, the instructor in that class more than three decades ago, decided to find out. In the fall of 1982, he performed a rudimentary series of tests and concluded that an armed attacker who bolted toward an \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  could clear 21 feet in the time it took most \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to draw, aim and fire their weapon. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   The next spring, Mr. Tueller published his findings in SWAT magazine and transformed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  training in the United States. The ''21-foot rule'' became dogma. It has been taught in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  academies around the country, accepted by courts and cited by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to justify countless shootings, including recent episodes involving a homeless woodcarver in Seattle and a schizophrenic woman in San Francisco. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   Now, amid the largest national debate over policing since the 1991 beating of Rodney King in Los Angeles, a small but vocal set of law enforcement officials are calling for a rethinking of the 21-foot rule and other axioms that have emphasized how to use force, not how to avoid it. Several big-city \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  departments are already re-examining when \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  should chase people or draw their guns and when they should back away, wait or try to defuse the situation.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   ''In a democratic society, people have a say in how they are policed, and people are saying that they are not satisfied with how things are going,'' said Sean Whent, the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  chief in Oakland, Calif. The city has a troubled history of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  abuse and misconduct, but some policy changes and a new approach to training have led to sharp declines in the use of force, Chief Whent added.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   Like the 21-foot rule, many current \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  practices were adopted when \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  faced violent street gangs. Crime rates soared, as did the number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  killed. Today, crime is at historic lows and most cities are safer than they have been in generations, for residents and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  alike. This should be a moment of high confidence in the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  said Chuck Wexler, executive director of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Executive Research Forum, a law enforcement policy group. Instead, he said, policing is in crisis.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   ''People aren't buying our brand. If it was a product, we'd take it out of the marketplace and re-engineer it,'' Mr. Wexler said. ''We've lost the confidence of the American people.''
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   Mr. Wexler's group will meet with hundreds of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  leaders in Washington this week to call for a new era of training, one that replaces truisms such as the 21-foot rule with lessons on defusing tense situations and avoiding violent confrontations. While the Justice Department and chiefs of some major \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  departments are supportive, the effort has not been widely embraced, at least so far. Some \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  unions and others have expressed skepticism, saying \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are being unfairly criticized.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   ''All this chatter just increases the idea that these encounters are avoidable and law enforcement is at fault,'' said Jeff Roorda of the St. Louis \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police Officers'\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Association, who said \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  already thought about ways to avoid confrontations.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   The typical \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cadet receives about 58 hours of training on how to use a gun and 49 hours on defensive tactics, according to a recent survey by Mr. Wexler's group. By comparison, cadets spend just eight hours learning to calm situations before force is needed, a technique called de-escalation.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   ''Everything now is: You get there, you see a guy with a knife, you resolve it,'' said Mr. Wexler, a former senior Boston \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  official. In many situations, he said, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  who find themselves 21 feet from a suspect can simply take a step backward to buy themselves time and safety.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   Mr. Tueller's article never proposed a bright line between a shooting that was justified and one that was not. In a telephone interview, Mr. Tueller, 63, said he had simply wanted to warn \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  that they might be in danger far sooner than they realized. Twenty-one feet as a justification for shooting, he said, just became a ''sticky idea'' in policing.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   The Dallas \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  chief, David O. Brown, said at a policing conference in February: ''Sometimes it seems like our young \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  want to get into an athletic event with people they want to arrest. They have a 'don't retreat' mentality. They feel like they're warriors and they can't back down when someone is running from them, no matter how minor the underlying crime is.''
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   Those remarks came just weeks before a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in North Charleston, S.C., was charged with murder for shooting an unarmed man in the back. The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  had stopped the man, Walter L. Scott, because of a broken brake light. When Mr. Scott ran, the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  gave chase, even though he had Mr. Scott's driver's license.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   ''In most cases, time is on our side,'' Chief Whent, of Oakland, said in an interview. ''We're chasing someone whose name we know, and we know where they live.''
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   The Oakland department, which is still working to repair its troubled history, now prohibits \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  from chasing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suspects\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  alone into yards or alleys if they might be \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  All \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  receive training that emphasizes smart decision-making. After averaging about eight \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shootings annually for many years, the city had none last year and cut in half the number of times \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  drew their guns, Chief Whent said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   Whether a shooting is justified often hinges on the fraction of a second before the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  fires. In Cleveland in November, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  thought that 12-year-old Tamir Rice was wielding a pistol, not realizing he was playing with a replica. In Ferguson, Mo., an \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  said he killed Michael Brown, 18, last summer because Mr. Brown had lunged at him after a scuffle through the window of his cruiser. In Seattle, the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  who shot the woodcarver said that the man had refused to drop his knife and that he had struck a ''very confrontational posture.''
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   But earlier decisions can also be critical. In Cleveland, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  pulled their cars extremely close to Tamir, immediately increasing the possibility of a confrontation. In Ferguson, the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Darren Wilson, got out of his car after the tussle and pursued Mr. Brown alone. In Seattle, internal investigators chastised the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Ian Birk, for approaching the armed man and then using the 21-foot rule to justify shooting him.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   ''\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Birk created the situation which he claims he had to use deadly force to get out of,'' a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  review board concluded. The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  resigned.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York announced a new training program for the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Department in December as the city faced waves of protests over the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man who died after a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  chokehold. Seattle, which is under federal supervision after a Justice Department civil rights investigation, recently announced that its \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  would also receive new training.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   Mr. Tueller, the retired Salt Lake City instructor, said that he supported improving \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  training, but that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were being unfairly blamed for the recent spate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 fatal\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shootings. Most, if not all, would have been avoided if the suspects had obeyed orders, he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   ''We can't get in people's heads, and we can't change behavior in many situations,'' he said. ''If they don't comply, the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has to have options. De-escalation is fine, to a point.''
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   Teaching \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to hesitate, Mr. Tueller said, could put them in danger.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   That focus on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  safety has underpinned many \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  policies, but Mr. Wexler argues that it is a false choice. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Britain, most of whom do not carry guns and typically face fewer suspects with firearms than some American \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  do, regularly confront suspects carrying knives, as do their counterparts here. British \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  follow what is known as the National Decision Model, which emphasizes talking, remaining patient and using no more force than necessary.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   No \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in England has died from a weapon attack during the past two years, according to the most recent published data, and none have been involved in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 fatal\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shootings during that period. (\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  with guns back up those who do not carry them.)
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   But Mr. Wexler acknowledged that changes in policing would be slow. ''Not everybody's going to accept it,'' he said. ''We're asking them to rethink in a major way things they have done for 20 years.''

\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 June 30--MT. JULIET -- An armed robbery Saturday evening at the Corner Market at 20 Benders Ferry Road remained under investigation Monday after the suspect was later found dead. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mt. Juliet \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  responded to an armed robbery call at about 8:30 p.m. at the Corner Market after a witness called 911. But before \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  could get there, the suspect fled the scene in a Ford Escape after apparently stealing a case of beer.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Investigators with the criminal investigations division responded to the scene. Their preliminary investigation revealed a man entered the store, grabbed a case of beer and ran out of the store. A 56-year-old clerk and 46-year-old witness confronted the suspect as he got into his car.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 During the confrontation, the suspect pulled a revolver and pointed it at the clerk and witness. As the suspect fled the scene, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  said the witness told them the suspect fired one gunshot out of the vehicle. No one was hit by gunfire or injured during the robbery.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 At about 10:30 p.m., Mt. Juliet \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  investigators confirmed the suspect was found dead at a home on Lakeview Drive in an unincorporated area of Wilson County. Wilson County \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 sheriff's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  investigators continued to look into the suspect's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 On Monday, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Sheriff\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Robert Bryan said \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 deputies\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  responded to 62 Lakeview Drive on Saturday at about 11 p.m. and found Kristopher Lee Green dead in the home from what appeared to be a gunshot wound. Bryan said a small-caliber handgun was recovered from the scene.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Bryan said Green's body was taken to the state medical examiner's office for autopsy, and the investigation remained open pending the results.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 During the investigation, Bryan said investigators found indications at the scene Green was a possible \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suspect\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in an \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  robbery that prior to the shooting at the Corner Market at the corner of Benders Ferry Road and Lebanon Road in Mt. Juliet. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Sheriff's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  investigators contacted Mt. Juliet \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and investigators from Mt. Juliet were investigating the armed robbery, Green and any possible connection between the two.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  said there is no active search under way for any suspects.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Our thoughts and prayers go out to the suspect's family, friends and loved ones," said Mt. Juliet \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Lt. Tyler Chandler. "The identity of the suspect will not be released until the Wilson County \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Sheriff's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Department completes [its] investigation."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Truck hits state trooper on I-95 in Caroline County
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  CAROLINE - A Virginia State Police trooper was seriously injured Wednesday morning after being hit by a vehicle while assisting with traffic control in Caroline County, according to state police Sgt. Steve Vick. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The trooper was hit at about 12:18 a.m. and taken to VCU Medical Center with serious but non-life-threatening injuries, Vick wrote in a statement.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The injured trooper was one of three troopers controlling traffic on southbound Interstate 95 near mile marker 108, north of the Ladysmith rest area, Vick said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  A tractor trailer lost control while approaching the scene and hit a state police vehicle and then a contract worker's parked pickup truck, Vick said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Once the tractor trailer hit the pickup truck, the pickup truck hit the trooper, who was on foot, sending the trooper over a guardrail, Vick said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  State police were directing traffic because there was high water on the interstate, according to Vick, who said the police vehicles' emergency lights were on at the time of the crash.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The contract worker was there to help the police, including by setting up cones, Vick said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The trooper was the only person injured, Vick said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Nicholas J. Coia, 67, of Florida, was the driver of the 2016 Kenworth tractor trailer and was charged with reckless driving, Vick said.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  YORKTOWN - The York-Poquoson \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Sheriff's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Office says that one of its \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 deputies\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shot and killed a 26-year-old Newport News man who was armed.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Sheriff's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Office says the shooting happened early Wednesday morning on Fort Eustis Boulevard in York County while the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 deputy\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was investigating a vehicle accident.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The office posted on its Facebook page that a confrontation ensued, and that Damien A. Harrell produced a handgun. The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 deputy\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shot Harrell, who was pronounced dead at Mary Immaculate Hospital.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Sheriff's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Office said Harrell, who was wanted for unspecified charges in another jurisdiction, had an extensive criminal history. It said Harrell was considered armed and dangerous with violent tendencies.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Authorities have not released the name of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 deputy\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  involved. An investigation into the shooting is ongoing.

\par \pard 
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 BYLINE: \b0 \i0 \ul0  By Christine Byers St. Louis Post-Dispatch Paul Hampel and Margaret Gillerman of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report.  
\par \pard 
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  BODY:
\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ST. LOUIS o St. Louis Circuit Attorney Jennifer Joyce announced Monday that no charges will be filed against the city \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  who shot and killed VonDerrit Myers Jr.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Joyce issued a press release and a report detailing an investigation her office conducted separately from \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  An assistant U.S. attorney helped with the investigation.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Joyce did not name the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in a 51-page report because he was not charged with a crime, but \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Chief Sam Dotson released a separate statement including the name of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Jason Flanery, which had become public months ago anyway.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The prosecutor's report on the Oct. 8 shooting reads, in part, "Given all the available facts, witness statements, physical and forensic evidence" prosecutors "have determined a criminal violation could not be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Therefore, charges will not be filed in this case." 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The material Joyce released suggested, in fact, that Flanery, 31, was attacked and shot Myers, 18, in self-defense while on patrol that night for a private residents' association in the Shaw neighborhood. The encounter occurred about 7:30 p.m. in the 4100 block of Shaw Boulevard.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But it did cast a new light on the beginnings of the incident, which Flanery had told investigators started when three youths ran from his marked security car, one of them holding his hand against his body as if securing a gun. The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  did not catch them, and approached Myers shortly later, believing it was the same person.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But Myers was wearing a GPS monitor on his ankle as a condition of his bail on charges from June 27 of unlawful use of a weapon and resisting arrest. "Based on this GPS information, it appears Myers was not the person \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  X was chasing..." the prosecutor's report says.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It puts Myers at the Shaw Market, where he also is seen on video, and then going home briefly, where acquaintances said they went for jackets.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  did have reason to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suspect\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  from Myers' behavior in their encounter that he was \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  the report says, and after they struggled had "probable cause to give chase." It was during the foot pursuit, officials said, that Myers fired at least three shots before Flanery returned fire. Flanery was not hit.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Flanery declined to be interviewed separately for Joyce's investigation, so his part of it was based on statements he made earlier to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  investigators.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The circumstances of the killing of Myers, who was black, by Flanery, who is white, drew angry protests as it occurred just two months after international attention focused on the killing of Michael Brown, who was black, by a white Ferguson \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Aug. 9.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 An attorney for the Myers family, Jerryl Christmas, challenged Joyce's report Monday and said he is close to filing a wrongful-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  lawsuit on their behalf.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Jason Flanery should have been charged with murder," Christmas said. "The killing of VonDerrit was the same situation as the Walter Scott killing with the exception that (Myers' shooting) was not on video." His was referring to the killing of an unarmed man who fled a South Carolina \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  who was charged with murder.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I don't believe for a minute that VonDerrit had a weapon," Christmas said. "Flanery threw that gun down on him just like they threw that stun gun down on Walter Scott in South Carolina." The lawyer claimed a private autopsy showed that Myers was shot in the back while fleeing and fatally in the head as he lay wounded on the ground.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Asked to account for photos circulated on social media of Myers in the past holding a gun that looked like the distinctive two-tone Smith & Wesson pistol recovered at the scene, Christmas replied, "Prosecutors can't say with any type of accuracy that's the same gun. All Smith & Wessons look alike."
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  initially described the confiscated gun as a Ruger, then changed it to Smith & Wesson, saying it was an honest mistake made in haste to provide the public with answers.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Christmas and about three dozen others gathered at 6 p.m. Monday at a makeshift memorial where Myers died.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I'm hurt because they took my grandbaby," Myers' grandmother Shelley Myers-Cotton told a reporter between sobs. She said the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  "needs to be in the jailhouse," adding, "Had it been me, I'd be in the jailhouse."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Myers' mother, Syreeta Myers, said she was "sick and tired" of seeing black children killed by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  "I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Joyce, the prosecutor, said that Myers' family attorneys never showed up for meetings, and neither provided access to witnesses they claimed disputed the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  statements nor a copy of the private autopsy. She said she issued grand jury subpoenas for three such witnesses, but one could not be found and the others cited Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Mr. Christmas did not produce any witnesses to us who saw what happened," Joyce said in an interview. "I have to assume that they did not have anything to offer that would have led to prosecuting the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  or they would have come forward."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Her report says, "Based upon the investigation, prosecutors concluded that Mr. Myers produced a firearm on the evening in question. Multiple witnesses confirm there was gunfire coming from both directions and from two different guns at the scene. Ballistics evidence confirms that two different guns were fired at the scene. There is no evidence that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  X ... was the person who fired both guns."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It adds, "No witness claims to have seen \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  X alter evidence in any way, such as throw down a gun, fire a weapon in any direction other than towards Mr. Myers or scatter bullet casings. Additionally, there are witnesses that describe how Mr. Myers illegally came into possession of the Smith and Wesson firearm used in this matter."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In December, the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  department said it found no criminal wrongdoing by Flanery. But under new procedures, the evidence still must be reviewed by the prosecutor for possible charges. Previously, prosecutors examined \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shootings only if the department asked.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The state crime lab found gunshot residue on Myers' hands, shirt and inside the waistband and pockets of his jeans. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  said such residue can be present on anyone near a shooting, but this was consistent with Myers firing a weapon.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 However, Joyce's investigation concluded that the residue was not proof either way. It also said it is "rare" to find DNA or fingerprints on a gun, and neither was found on this one.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The location of bullets, casings, bullet tracks and damage are consistent with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  X's and other witnesses' versions of events," the report said.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  said three bullets matching the gun found with Myers had hit the ground near where Flanery said he tried to take cover. A round that pierced a car behind the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was too damaged for a match but not consistent with the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  bullets.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dotson said Flanery has more than six years of service and was working an approved secondary job at the time.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We appreciate the community's patience as this investigation was conducted and commend the dedicated and thorough work of both the Circuit Attorney's Office and the Force Investigative Unit," Dotson wrote. "I have pledged transparency to the citizens of St. Louis and am committed to upholding this promise."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Protesters took to the streets of the Shaw neighborhood after Myers' \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  The first night, rocks were thrown through windows of some homes and at least one business, three \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  vehicles were vandalized, and flags taken from porches were burned.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to Joyce's report, Flanery told investigators his reaction was slowed that night by thoughts of Ferguson: "I didn't want to be wrong in my shoot. I knew it was a gun but, I just, I, I wanted to be certain. So I didn't shoot, I hesitated."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Flanery's attorney, Brian Millikan, said Monday: "There's obviously a mix of emotions right now because it brings it all back up again." He added, "We are relieved it's over and they concluded that no crime was committed.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "That's what we expected. They obviously did a very thorough investigation."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Millikan said Flanery became the subject of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  threats after Christmas made the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  name public months ago.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "He's certainly aware of his surroundings, let's put it that way," Millikan said. "But he's continuing on with his normal job and doing it well and trying not to let this whole incident change his perspective on what he does."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 With the completion of the prosecutor's investigation into the Myers shooting, Joyce said she will turn her attention to a review of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 fatal\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shooting of Kajieme Powell on Aug. 19 by two city \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  who said he came at them with a knife. A bystander's cellphone video included the sound of Powell shouting, "Shoot me! Kill me now!"
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Joyce said it is too soon to know how long that investigation would take.

\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 People who knew the victim of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 fatal\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  May 20 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shooting at the Guelph General Hospital will honour him Monday with a pizza dinner.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 They will gather to remember Brandon Duncan at a downtown agency that serves local homeless and marginalized residents.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Meanwhile, local political activists are planning to protest the use of lethal weapons by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Ed Pickersgill co-ordinates 40 Baker St., which houses several programs and organizations that serve "the unemployed, needy and dispossessed," according to its website. Duncan was a longtime client of Fresh Start Housing Centre. Fresh Start helps the homeless find shelter and sustainable housing.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Duncan, 36, was killed in the emergency department at about 1:30 p.m. on May 20, during an interaction with two Guelph \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police officers.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He was shot multiple times. The SIU has 12 investigators probing the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Duncan suffered from mental illness, addiction, and Crohn's disease, according to friends and associates in the community.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He accessed services for the homeless over at least a 15-year period, and had several lengthy stays in hospital related to Crohn's.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Pickersgill is dedicating the Monday pizza dinner at 40 Baker Street to Duncan. It runs from 4:15 p.m. to 5:15 p.m. People will be invited to share their thoughts and reactions on a large sheet of paper.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 On the Facebook event page for the memorial, Pickersgill states Duncan was in "a serious personal crisis resulting from homelessness, Crohn's, addiction, loneliness and fear," at the time of his \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We at 40 Baker Street would like to share our pizza day supper on Monday 1st of June in memory of Brandon Duncan so that (1) his \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  not go unmarked in his community; and (2) pizza and juice and music on that day be an occasion for those who knew him personally and for those who have shared in similar circumstances to have a chance to give a nod of understanding that his life did matter and that he simply should not have died the way he did."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Area funeral homes have been contacted and none is as yet managing memorial/burial arrangements for Duncan. The SIU would not comment this week on whether Duncan's body has been released for burial.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It's unclear where Duncan's next of kin reside. The SIU said a family member consented to release his name to the public. That person's identity has not been made public. Associates of Duncan in Guelph have asserted that they have no knowledge of him having relatives in the city. They believe he was raised in Fergus by his grandparents, who are deceased.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Monday's event at 40 Baker Street may also involve planning for a protest at an upcoming Guelph \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Services Board meeting, said Sakura Saunders.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Saunders is a local political activist, a volunteer with the Ontario Public Interest Research Group, and a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  accountability activist. She is also the founder of the group Disarm Toronto \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and advocates for the disarming of front line \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 She said discussions are underway to organize a Guelph protest or advocacy event against the use of lethal force by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Activists are planning to attend a Guelph \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Service public meeting at the Shelldale Centre on Tuesday. That session is an input forum related to the development of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  service's next strategic business plan.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "People are definitely disturbed about it," Saunders said, speaking of the Duncan shooting.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I have seen a number of cases (elsewhere) of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shooting people who were attempting self-harm or having mental health issues - coming in and shooting first and asking questions later," she said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 While the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 fatal\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shooting of Duncan was the first by a Guelph \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police officer,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Saunders said in the two years between August 2011 and August 2013, Toronto \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were engaged with 14 people who died. Seven of those were shot to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  She said none of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 victims\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was as heavily \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed as the police.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "This is one of the reasons I advocate that front line \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are disarmed, and that only a special force has lethal weapons," she said, speaking of the Duncan incident. "I think the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  should have been securing the area and making sure that people were safe, including the person they ended up killing, rather than using lethal means."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The next meeting of the Guelph \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Services Board is June 18.

\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 People who knew the victim of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 fatal\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  May 20 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shooting at the Guelph General Hospital will honour him Monday with a pizza dinner.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 They will gather to remember Brandon Duncan at a downtown agency that serves local homeless and marginalized residents.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Meanwhile, local political activists are planning to protest the use of lethal weapons by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Ed Pickersgill co-ordinates 40 Baker Street, which houses several programs and organizations that serve "the unemployed, needy and dispossessed," according to its website. Duncan was a longtime client of Fresh Start Housing Centre, which is located at 40 Baker St. Fresh Start helps the homeless find shelter and sustainable housing.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Duncan, 36, was killed in the emergency department at about 1:30 p.m. on May 20, during an interaction with two Guelph \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police officers.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  He was shot multiple times. The Special Investigations Unit has been assigned to the case.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Duncan suffered from mental illness, addiction, and Crohn's disease, according to friends and associates in the community. He accessed services for the homeless over at least a 15-year period, and had several lengthy stays in hospital related to Crohn's.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Pickersgill is dedicating the Monday pizza dinner at 40 Baker St. to Duncan. It runs from 4:15 p.m. to 5:15 p.m. People will be invited to share their thoughts and reactions on a large sheet of paper.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 On the Facebook event page for the memorial, Pickersgill states Duncan was in "a serious personal crisis resulting from homelessness, Crohn's, addiction, loneliness and fear," at the time of his \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We at 40 Baker Street would like to share our pizza day supper on Monday 1st of June in memory of Brandon Duncan so that (1) his \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  not go unmarked in his community; and (2) pizza and juice and music on that day be an occasion for those who knew him personally and for those who have shared in similar circumstances to have a chance to give a nod of understanding that his life did matter and that he simply should not have died the way he did."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Area funeral homes have been contacted and none is as yet managing memorial/burial arrangements for Duncan. The SIU would not comment this week on whether Duncan's body has been released for burial.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It's unclear where Duncan's next of kin reside. The SIU said a family member consented to release his name to the public. That person's identity has not been made public. Associates of Duncan in Guelph have asserted that they have no knowledge of him having relatives in the city. They believe he was raised in Fergus by his grandparents, who are deceased.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Monday's event may also involve planning for a protest at an upcoming Guelph \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Services Board meeting, said Sakura Saunders, a local political activist, a volunteer with the Ontario Public Interest Research Group, and a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  accountability activist. She is also the founder of the group Disarm Toronto \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and advocates for the disarming of front line \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 She said discussions are underway to organize a Guelph protest or advocacy event against the use of lethal force by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Activists are planning to attend a Guelph \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Service public meeting at the Shelldale Centre on Tuesday. That session is an input forum related to the development of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  service's next strategic business plan.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "People are definitely disturbed about it," Saunders said, speaking of the Duncan shooting.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I have seen a number of cases (elsewhere) of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shooting people who were attempting self-harm or having mental health issues - coming in and shooting first and asking questions later," she said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 While the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 fatal\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shooting of Duncan was the first by a Guelph \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police officer,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Saunders said in the two years between August, 2011 and August, 2013, Toronto \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were engaged with 14 people who died. Seven of those were shot to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  She said none of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 victims\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was as heavily \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed as the police.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The next meeting of the Guelph \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Services Board is June 18.

\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 An armed 74-year-old woman who held \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 sheriff\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  s \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 deputies\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in a 22-hour standoff near Woodland Hills last week was fasting and had not slept for days when she suffered what one son called  a manic break. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 At a Tuesday afternoon news conference at Los Angeles County \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Sheriff\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  s Department headquarters in Monterey Park, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 sheriff\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  s officials explained how an initial distress call of an elderly woman having difficulty breathing devolved into what \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Sheriff\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Jim McDonnell called  a life or \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  situation  for the woman and authorities. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   Video: Family says woman had not shown signs of mental health issues
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The incident began about 5:30 a.m. Thursday when the woman placed a call for medical assistance from the Woodland Park Mobile Estates at 4201 Topanga Canyon Blvd., an unincorporated section of the city.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 When a firefighter approached to ask the woman how he could help her, she pulled a gun and fled into the park.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Sheriff\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  s \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 deputies\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  later found her sitting in an alcove on the back porch of a home. That s when \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 deputies\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  sent in a robot to the area, said Lt. Bruce Chase.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Chase said the woman fired two rounds at the robot, causing the department to try other tactics   tear gas, light and sound diversion, water and less lethal impact devices   to coax her out of hiding.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nothing worked.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  We were trying to separate her from the gun,  Chase said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 At one point, the woman burrowed underneath the home where she fired three additional rounds at authorities.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 She lived in another home at the park for about 10 years, according to family members.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  It was 18 hours into the operation that the command staff decided no more chemical agents or less lethal impact devices should be used,  McDonnell said.  She has shown zero reaction to any of it and the cumulative effect of more could seriously injure or possibly kill her. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 At 3:30 a.m. Friday, five \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 deputies\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were sent under the house to forcibly remove the woman. Only three of the five \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 deputies\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were armed and none could wear any protective gear due to the small space.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Meanwhile, the woman had one round left in her revolver.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  We were prepared to use deadly force if we had to. It would have been extremely depressing to everybody involved ... if it had ended in the use of deadly force,  Chase said.  In this particular case, ... they were going head first against an \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed suspect\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  with no tactical protection. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Chase declined to comment on what exactly occurred beneath the home but said the woman was handcuffed and taken into custody without incident.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The woman has not been charged and was still being treated Tuesday for a hand injury at Northridge Hospital Medical Center. She initially suffered from hypothermia following the overnight incident. No one else was injured.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Her two sons, who declined to be identified, said she had never exhibited signs of mental health issues prior to the incident. It wasn t until an email she sent to her sons on Wednesday night that they realized something was wrong.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  She went down all these different threads, was never able to come back on track and said she was writing a book that would change the world,  her elder son said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The two planned to check on her that weekend, not imagining what would unfold over the next 24 hours. Neither son knew she had a gun, they said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Fortunately she was physically tough enough to endure a situation that she put herself in,  one son said.  We re so proud of the whole team of law enforcement for their restraint and compassion.

\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  BODY:
\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  had just shot and killed an \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 unarmed\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  minority \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suspect\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  who had been trying to flee.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A fellow \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  dashboard camera caught the aftermath.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Grant Morrison walks away from the scene of the shooting, his head in his hand, reaches the side of his colleague's cruiser, and collapses, sobbing uncontrollably.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 For minutes on end, all that can be heard on the video is a fellow \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  repeating, over and over, "I've got you." 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Barely able to speak, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Morrison stammers, "I thought he was going to pull a gun on me."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A colleague leans over, consolingly, and whispers. "Maybe he was, maybe he was.... You survived."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The actions of a Billings, Mont., \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  bear little relation with whatever transpired before and after Freddie Gray was loaded, handcuffed and unbuckled, into a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  van in Baltimore weeks ago. Mr. Gray died a week later of a severe neck injury suffered while in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  custody.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But the Montana dashcam video offers at least a glimpse into why many \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  look at the indictment of six \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Friday in the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of Gray with no small amount of trepidation. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 For years, prosecutors and the United States Supreme Court have given \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  wide leeway in their use of deadly force. Now, the terms of that societal contract are up for robust debate, at the very least. If they are to change - as protesters from Ferguson, Mo., to North Charleston, S.C., have demanded - the question is how much? 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Many \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  agree they must be held accountable to the law. But they wonder if society recognizes the difficulty of the task they are often set, and whether in the anger of the present the pendulum of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  reform could swing too far the other way.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The big picture is that the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are always held accountable for what elected officials can't provide for the people - for failed infrastructure and failed policy," retired Baltimore \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Leon Taylor told Slate.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In Baltimore, the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were tasked with holding the line between impoverished West Baltimore and the gentrifying urban core. Whether the tactics Baltimore \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have used are necessary to maintain law and order will be addressed - either directly or implicitly - in the trial of the six \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 If the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ran afoul of the law, many fellow \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  nationwide will want to see them held responsible.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "First of all, the fundamental purpose of law enforcement is to bring violators of the law to justice, even if those violators of the law are law enforcement themselves," Dana Schrad, executive director for the Virginia Chiefs of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Association, told WBT-TV in Richmond, Va. "The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  will have their day in court and justice will be based on the evidence."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But there is a sense among some \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  that society does not appreciate the complexities and mental toll of a job where the ability to deal out \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is holstered on your hip, and the authority to do it is a badge pinned to your chest.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The public thinks the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are above the law, but the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  see themselves as expendable," former \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Taylor told Slate.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In the Montana case, Morrison killed Richard Ramirez at a traffic stop in April 2014. After being told several times to put his hands up, Mr. Ramirez, who was high on methamphetamines, reached into his waistband, Morrison told a jury at a coroner's inquest.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I knew in that moment, which later was determined to be untrue, but I knew in that moment that he was reaching for a gun," Morrison said, according to Yahoo News. "I couldn't take that risk.... I wanted to see my son grow up."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A 2011 reaction-time study found that if an \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  waits until an \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed suspect\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  raises his gun to shoot, the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suspect\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  will likely get off the first shot. The Montana jury found that Morrison was justified in shooting Ramirez.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The fallout from Ferguson, however, has begun to change the calculus of policing. An Ohio \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  won national praise for not shooting a murder suspect despite the fact that the man charged him with his hand in his pocket, telling the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to shoot him.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Moreover, some \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  departments are working to open a dialogue with the black community.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I'd much rather they shout at me at a town hall meeting at a church and get to know me afterward than not have a relationship," Dallas \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Chief David Brown told the Associated Press. After a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shooting has already happened, "it's too late to try to establish relationships."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The concern is that the passion of the moment could lead to a reverse prejudice.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "In my 20-year career as a law enforcement \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and 16 years as an attorney I have never seen such a rush to file criminal charges, which I believe are driven by forces separate and apart from the application of law and the facts of this case as we've heard them," Michael Davey, a lawyer for one of the Baltimore \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  told the media.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Ultimately, however, those \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  will have to explain themselves, some \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  say.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Unfortunately I have to agree with the decision," Joseph Giacalone, a retired New York \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Department detective sergeant, told Slate. "Because I have no answer to why they threw him into the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  van in the first place. What was the charge? Why did they arrest him? He didn't commit any crime."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "A lot of the guys I've spoken to feel the same thing I do."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 DETECTIVES are today piecing together Jed Allen's movements in the hours before the bodies of his sister, mother and her partner were discovered in Didcot.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Det Supt Chris Ward released these two CCTV pictures of Allen - named as a suspect in the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 deaths\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Vicarage Road - taken from Oxford Station just before 6pm on Saturday night. The bodies were discovered just after 8pm.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr Ward said: "We believe that Jed boarded a train from Didcot to Oxford at 5.24pm and arrived in Oxford at 5.45pm.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "He was then captured on CCTV at the WHSmith store at Oxford railway station just before 6pm.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Jed is wearing a red or maroon shirt, a dark hooded jacket with a white trim on the zip, blue jeans and black shoes.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "After visiting WHSmith, we believe that Jed then walked to Oxford University Parks.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Jed is white, about 6ft, of stocky build, and has a distinctive tattoo of a spider on his left hand.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "If you see Jed please do not approach him, instead call 999 immediately.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We would urge anyone with any other information about the incident to contact us via 101 quoting a new reference number of 465 (24/5). Did you see or hear anything suspicious in Vicarage Road on Saturday? If you did then we want to hear from you."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr Ward also confirmed what is believed to be the murder weapon was found at the property in Vicarage Road.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Whilst post mortem examinations are yet to be carried out, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have said they believe the victims were stabbed.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr Ward also issued a warning to anyone sheltering Allen, 21.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said: "If you don't want to speak directly to the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or online at www.crimestoppers-uk.org. No personal details are taken, information is not traced or recorded and you will not go to court.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "If anyone is harbouring Jed Allen then you need to know that this is a serious offence and we would ask you to contact us immediately."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr Ward added: "At this time no arrests have been made in this investigation.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The post mortems of the victims are scheduled to take place today (25/5) and tomorrow (26/5).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Our search of Oxford University Parks continues today with more than 100 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  involved, including national specialist search \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  who have now joined the search.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I can confirm that what we believe to be the murder weapon was found at the scene of the murder in Vicarage Road, Didcot.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Finally, I would like to thank all those members of the public who have called in with information, as well as the media who have published our appeals."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 John Myers, the headteacher at All Saint's Primary School where Derin was in Year 1, said the family had just moved, but had most of their connections in the area.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr Myers said: "She was a beautiful little girl, happy and gentle and smiley. She was a wonderful little child."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said he felt "shocked and devastated", adding: "As you can suspect I was just shocked when I heard. It's hard to believe, but it's also the manner of it as well. To lose any life is awful and lose a child is doubly so. But the nature of this loss is hard to take in and comprehend."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 People have now gathered at the Ladygrove Children's Centre at the school, which is due to be open until 3pm today.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr Myers added: "I was here yesterday afternoon talking with friends and we just thought we needed to offer a place for people to go.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "People need a place to gather at times like this. We thought we should open up our doors and offer tea and coffee and a vicar.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We have tea lights and candles and people can pray and there's gentle music."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Flowers and tributes are being left at a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cordon on the street, barely yards from the murder scene.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Today Didcot's Ladygrove Children's Centre at All Saint's School, where Derin was a pupil, will be open from 10am until 3pm for families to gather with their children in support and remembrance.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Multi-coloured ribbons are also being tied around lamp posts in the area as a tribute to the three.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The main colours being chosen are blue for Mr Howard, purple or red for Ms Jordon and pink for six-year-old Derin, who was known affectionately as "Dezzy."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cordon remains on Vicarage Road, but Oxford University Parks has reopened after \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  closed it off yesterday.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A full-scale manhunt, involving more than 100 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was launched as Allen was named as a suspect in the case.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  said the most likely cause of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was stabbing, and post mortem examinations are expected to be carried out today.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Searches in Didcot and Oxford are expected to continue today as \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  unravel what happened to the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 victims.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Yesterday \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  descended on University Parks in Oxford as part of the investigation. The parks' gates were shut and the grounds remained closed for most of the day.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This morning the gates were unlocked and the park appeared to have reopened.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Flowers and cuddly toys have been left on the cordon in Didcot, just yards from the crime scene.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A tribute signed by Mary, Dilly and Mally started: "To my best friend Jan, Dezzy & my anorexic Phil & my gorgeous boy Jed,

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 How the investigation developed over Saturday and Sunday
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Det Supt Chris Ward said the most likely cause of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 deaths\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of the trio - whose bodies were found in their home in Vicarage Road just before 8.30pm on Saturday - was stabbing.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Neighbours in Didcot have told the Oxford Mail that Allen regularly stayed at the family's previous address in Wensum Drive.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr Howard was 44, Ms Jordon 48 and Derin six and Mr Ward said: "We offer our condolences to the family. This is obviously a tragic and sad event."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr Ward, of Thames Valley \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  major crime unit, said \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were hunting for Allen, 21, as the force released a picture of him and appealed for anyone who sees him to call them on 101.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He added that post mortem examinations will be carried out today.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were called to the property just before 8.30pm on Saturday

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 All were carrying riot shields and they marched northwards into the grounds.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The gates were locked and a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  helicopter was seen hovering over the area.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A lot of activity appeared to be happening toward the north-east end of the grounds, near the River Cherwell.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Passers-by were told by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and Oxford University security \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  that the parks would be shut all day.

\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  confirmed that Allen was once a groundskeeper for Oxford Univeristy and Didcot Town Council's website lists a man of the same name having been an apprentice gardener with the authority.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 At a press conference yesterday morning, Mr Ward appealed for the public's help to find Allen.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said: "It is very important that we locate him as quickly as we can.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I do not believe that there are any dangers to the wider community of Oxford, however given the nature of what we are dealing with, it's imporatnt that we find him as quickly and safely as possible."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Allen is 21, of large build, white, and has a distinctive tattoo of a spider on his left hand, Mr Ward said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He was related to the victims.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Allen was formerly a groundsman for Oxford University, Mr Ward said, and there are searches going on in relation to that.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 His Facebook page says he studied at Marlborough School. He came from Didcot but now lives in Oxford, the page also says.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr Ward said claims that a firearm was involved in their \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 deaths\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were not true but added: "I do not want to speculate at the cause of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  at the moment.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I don't know how long the victims were [dead in the house] but we are concentrating on the last 24 hours."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Their families had been informed of their \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 deaths,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Mr Ward added.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The three people had moved in to the house only within the past two months but had lived in the area before that.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr Ward is now appealing for anyone who was in Vicarage Road in the past 24 hours to call detectives on 101 quoting a new reference number of 465 (24/5).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The road is now sealed off as \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  carry out their investigations.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Three scenes of crime \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were seen going into the house about 8.15am  yesterday.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There were at least 12 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  at the scene.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  held a press conference at 10.30am and we will be covering it live as it happens.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A former landlady of Ms Jordon said that she had known the 48-year-old and Allen when they rented a house from her in Kidlington.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Jane Ilott, 68, said: "I didn't know Jed as a 6ft man, I know him as a little fella who was really struggling."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The pensioner explained that her 48-year-old former tenant was not the kind of person that you got to know well, and that she moved into one of her houses before moving to Didcot.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "He lived with his dad and he was a lovely, lovely boy. He would come down some weekends, he would either be with his nan, who lives in Kidlington, or with his mum.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 She continued: "We did far more than a landlord and landlady would have done, we tried to be good neighbours."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Asked if there was a man in Ms Jordon's life when she was living in Kidlington, Mrs Illot said: "I used to get knocks on the door, little disagreements with people knocking on my door and asking for the keys and I would say 'No'.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Adding that she would turn them away even when they claimed that Ms Jordon had said it was ok for them to go in, Mrs Ilott said: "That would be one of many, I'm only being honest. I'm not saying she was a nasty girl because she wasn't, she was a lovely girl with a problem."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Det Chief Insp Simon Steel of the Thames Valley \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Major Crime Unit, said: "Thames Valley \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has launched a murder investigation in Didcot after receiving a call from a member of the public at 8.23pm yesterday (23/5).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attended the scene and three bodies were found inside the property.

\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  BODY:
\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  US Department of Justice, The Government of USA has issued the following news release: 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Thank you, Steve [Edwards, Executive Director of the Institute of Politics], for inviting me here today. It's an honor to speak with you about the work of the Civil Rights Division, particularly our work to ensure that policing is done in accordance with the Constitution and to help local \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  departments and the communities they serve build trust where it has eroded.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Eric Garner. Tamir Rice. John Crawford. Walter Scott. Freddie Gray.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 These names and many others have become familiar to us under tragic circumstances in recent months. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Their \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 deaths\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and those of other unarmed African-American men and women in encounters with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have provoked widespread responses across the country and have fueled the Black Lives Matter movement. In communities of color, in particular, the reaction has been stark and sobering. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In the seven months I have been at the Civil Rights Division, I have spent a lot of time with local leaders and community members in cities all across America, including with numerous mothers who have lost their children in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -involved shootings. The pain, anger, frustration--the lack of trust in the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 --is real, and it is profound. Again and again, people have told me that young people are losing faith in our justice system and view law enforcement as preying on them rather than protecting their loved ones. They talk about how the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  don't value their rights, or indeed, their lives. They talk about being tired of being viewed as criminals first, human beings second.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The conversation in these rooms, however, is not about whether to have \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  or not, but about what kind of policing communities want and deserve. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There is no question that we need \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in our communities. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ensure the safety of our communities by patrolling neighborhoods, defending the rights of victims and deterring crime. They are our first responders in many emergency situations. And they can be role models for our young people.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The overwhelming majority of the women and men who \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  our streets do their jobs with honor, pride and distinction. Most of these individuals are driven to the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  academy out of a commitment to public service and a desire to make an impact in their communities. As we are reminded by the senseless and tragic assassinations of New York \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Department (NYPD) Detectives Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu in December, the shooting of two \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Ferguson in March, and the tragic injuries inflicted on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Baltimore a few weeks ago, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  do all of this at considerable risk to themselves.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 I am struck everywhere I go by the wide gap in empathy and common language to discuss these problems. Because in the very same cities and rooms where I speak with folks in the community, I hear from law enforcement who emphasize their responsibility to enforce the law and how they are doing the best job they can. They feel attacked and undervalued. They talk about how the actions of a few bad actors have tarnished the whole profession. They talk about the fact that department budgets have been slashed over the last several years, resulting in drastic cuts for community policing and neighborhood patrols. They point out that they are constantly making split second decisions and people don't account for the thousands of times situations don't escalate. They talk about how the daily stress of their jobs takes a toll. And they are right about all of this.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Despite these divergent themes, there is one commonality in all rooms I am in. And that is that everyone agrees that we are confronting grave challenges when it comes to the erosion of trust between \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and the communities they serve throughout the United States. The level of mistrust and resentment is unsettling. Some, including NYPD Commissioner William Bratton, call it a "crisis."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The consequences of distrust between law enforcement and the communities they serve can be devastating. Where people perceive the criminal justice system to be arbitrary, biased and unfair, they are less likely to cooperate with law enforcement, making us all less safe. The distrust and alienation experienced in some communities can build into a powder keg of resentment, ready to be ignited by a single tragic incident. We have seen this over and over--in Watts in 1965, in Los Angeles in 1992 and most recently, in Ferguson in 2014.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It's worth asking, first, how did we get here? And second, what are we going to do about it? 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Let's start with the first question and consider the source of the mistrust. Mistrust can't be explained away as the kneejerk reaction of the ill-informed or the hyperbolic. It has many sources. For some people, it's in part the product of historical awareness about the role that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  played, as Commissioner Bratton recently told a group of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in "slavery, Reconstruction, Jim Crow, lynchings, blockbusting." FBI Director James Comey has likewise noted, "At many points in American history, law enforcement enforced the status quo, a status quo that was often brutally unfair to disfavored groups." As Commissioner Bratton explained, this history has an enduring effect. "None of us did these things," he told his audience of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  "None of us were troopers on the bridge at Selma. But it doesn't matter that these things happened before many of us were even born. What matters is that our history follows us like a second shadow."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The mistrust is also the product of lived experience, of negative interactions that individuals - or their family members, friends or neighbors - have had with law enforcement. Something as quietly humiliating as being mistreated during a traffic stop, or being followed in a retail store. These stories can circulate through a neighborhood - or these days, across the nation via the web and social media - and they can build up over time into a painful narrative that divides community members and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The lack of trust also undeniably results from our criminal justice policies over the last few decades, and the concentrated impact they have had on communities of color and people living in poverty. Law enforcement practices such as the stopping and frisking of young black men based on stereotypes. Sentencing policies that result in mass incarceration, particularly of people of color. And the devastating consequences that convictions have had on individuals' ability to find work, secure stable housing and reintegrate as full members of society. We bear the responsibility to confront these consequences and reevaluate our approach to criminal justice.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Civil Rights Division's investigation and March 2015 report on the Ferguson \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Department (FPD) speaks to much of what I have been talking about.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In Ferguson, we found a community where unlawful \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  practices created an intensely charged atmosphere where people feel under siege by those charged to serve and protect them. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 We determined that the FPD engages in a pattern or practice of conduct that violates the United States Constitution and federal law. Specifically, we found that Ferguson PD routinely:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Conducts stops without reasonable suspicion and arrests without probable cause, in violation of the Fourth Amendment;
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Uses excessive force in violation of the Fourth Amendment;
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Unlawfully interferes with First Amendment rights, including the right to record and to protest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  activity;
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Impermissibly discriminates against African Americans in violation of the 14th Amendment and federal statutory law; and
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Violates due process and equal protection in the operation of its Municipal Court.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 We found that this unconstitutional conduct stems from the interaction of two dynamics: Ferguson's undue focus on revenue generation through policing and pervasive racial bias in the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  department and court system.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 These dynamics fostered unconstitutional practices at nearly every level of Ferguson's law enforcement system. One example: During the summer of 2012, a Ferguson \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  detained a 32-year-old African-American man who had just finished playing basketball at a park. The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  approached while the man was sitting in his car, cooling off. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The car's windows appeared to be more heavily tinted than Ferguson's code allowed, so the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  may have had grounds to question him. But, with no apparent justification, the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  proceeded to escalate the situation, accusing the man of being a pedophile. He prohibited the man from using his cell phone and ordered him out of his car for a pat-down search, even though he had no reason to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suspect\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  that the man was \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  And when the man objected - citing his constitutional rights - the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  drew his gun, pointed it at the man's head and arrested him on eight different counts. The arrest caused the man to lose his job.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 We observed that even minor code violations can sometimes result in multiple arrests, jail time and payments that exceed the cost of the original ticket many times over.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 For example, in 2007, one woman received two parking tickets that - together - totaled $152. To date, she has paid $550 in fines and fees to the city of Ferguson. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 She's been arrested twice for having unpaid tickets and she has spent six days in jail. Yet she still - inexplicably - owes Ferguson $541. Her story is only one of dozens of similar accounts that our investigation uncovered.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In Ferguson, we also found evidence of unlawful discrimination. African Americans make up 67 percent of the population, but from 2012 to 2014, they constituted:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  85 percent of the people subject to a vehicle stop;
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  90 percent of people who received a citation; and
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  93 percent of people arrested.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 And discretionary \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  actions were overwhelmingly concentrated on the black population. To take just one example, 95 percent of "manner of walking in roadway" charges - that's jaywalking - were levied against African Americans.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 We found racial disparities in virtually every available metric. From 2012 to 2014, African Americans were more than twice as likely as white drivers to be searched during vehicle stops, but 26 percent less likely to be found in possession of contraband. In 88 percent of cases in which FPD documented the use of force, force was used against African Americans. In all cases in which canines were used against subjects for whom racial information is available, the subject was African-American.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The evidence of racial bias comes not only from statistics, but also from remarks made by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and court supervisors in disturbing email messages. The emails were incontrovertible evidence of a culture infected by racial bias.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 These findings reveal that the public trust in Ferguson law enforcement and its criminal justice system, especially among African Americans, was damaged long before August 2014. When there is this level of broad community distrust, public safety suffers and the job of delivering \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  services is rendered more difficult and more dangerous.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In many ways, Ferguson is not an anomaly. We know from our work around the country that some of the same \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and court practices that we identified in Ferguson - and the same deficit of trust between \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and communities - exist in many other places. Local officials recognize this, as well. I know of several \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  chiefs around the country who have assigned the report as required reading for their \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  And in light of the report, cities around the country are beginning to re-examine their policing and municipal court practices. Undoubtedly, there is much more work to do, but there's also much to be hopeful about.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In many communities, thoughtful \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and city leaders are working to re-prioritize community policing and rebuild community trust. Take Cleveland. Mayor Frank Jackson asked the Civil Rights Division to investigate the Cleveland Division of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  (CDP) in March 2013. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In December 2014, we announced the results of our investigation, concluding that Cleveland \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  engage in a pattern or practice of unreasonable and unnecessary force, including deadly force such as shootings and head strikes with impact weapons. We also found that the pattern of excessive force had eroded public confidence in the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Thanks to the commitment of Mayor Jackson, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Chief Calvin Williams, the city's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  unions and community members, we entered into a negotiated reform agreement a mere five months after issuing our initial report. The agreement takes the form of a consent decree that will be independently monitored and enforceable in court.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It's a truly innovative and comprehensive agreement. It addresses \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  needs by requiring CDP to develop an Equipment and Resource Plan to ensure that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have the equipment they need - such as computers and safe vehicles - to do their jobs safely. It calls for additional training and an effective employee assistance program to give \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ready access to mental health and support resources. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It sets up a new Community \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Commission - made up of 10 civilian representatives from across the city and one member from each of the city's three \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  unions - that will work with the Division of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to improve community policing, bias-free policing and transparency. Through this body, the Cleveland community will play a central role in the development of many important \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 polices,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  including those related to use of force and search and seizure.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The agreement also calls for:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  A civilian head of Internal Affairs, to ensure that internal investigations of misconduct are impartial and reliable;
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Specialized training in interacting with persons in mental health crisis, and a Mental Health Response Advisory Committee to foster relationships between the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  the community and mental health providers;
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Revised use-of-force policies and training that will require \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to use de-escalation techniques, rather than force, wherever possible;
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Strengthened reporting and supervision requirements, along with broad data collection; and
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Many other provisions aimed at promoting public safety and building trust between the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and the community.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Cleveland agreement reflects a commitment by the City and the Division of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to work with the Cleveland community to transform this \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  agency into a model of community-oriented policing. The agreement also demonstrates that people can come together across perceived differences to realize a common vision of a safer, more just city.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Baltimore is another city in which local officials are stepping up to tackle longstanding divisions and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -community divisions. Last month, Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake asked us to investigate the Baltimore \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Department for a pattern or practice of civil rights violations. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 That same day, the City's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  commissioner and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  union released statements agreeing with the Mayor's request and welcoming our involvement. Gene Ryan, President of the Baltimore City Fraternal Order of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Lodge No. 3, released a statement stating that the union intends to "fully cooperate with any investigation that has the potential to correct departmental deficiencies and improve the morale of our members . . . As the labor union that represents the nearly 3,000 active duty members of the agency, we agree with (the) Mayor on her invitation to the Department of Justice and welcome their investigation fully as we, too, have issues with many of the current policies and procedures of the department." After considering the relevant factors, we accepted the City's invitation and opened an investigation.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Wherever this investigation may lead - we don't know what we'll find, and we will never prejudge any outcome - our goal is to work with the community, public officials, law enforcement \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  unions to help build a stronger, better Baltimore. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 As events in both Cleveland and Baltimore show, the commitment of all of these local actors is essential if we are to move forward. To restore trust where it has been badly eroded. To promote healing - and address problems that are common to so many great cities across America.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 I said there were two questions - what the sources of mistrust are and what we are going to do about it. The second question is hard, but we have an unprecedented opportunity now to address fundamental problems in the way communities across the country interact with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and with the criminal justice system more generally. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 While the Civil Rights Division and others in this room and beyond have been working on policing issues for many years, the nation is paying attention because communities are demanding it. The reality is we tend to confront systemic problems only when forced to by seemingly extraordinary events. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Journalists now are doing impressive investigative reporting on excessive force, racial profiling and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -community relations. Universities are doing important research and analysis of these problems. And families are talking about them at the dinner table.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Importantly, the focus on policing issues is happening in a broader conversation about the need to reform our criminal justice system. There is no question, and I speak from personal experience, that 15 years ago, criminal justice reform was a lonely endeavor. Few on the Left or the Right were willing to champion its cause. Today, there is a widespread, even bipartisan, recognition that our criminal justice system needs an overhaul that it should not be the go-to answer for social problems and that mass incarceration has damaged this country in countless ways. Law enforcement leaders themselves talk about how they have become first responders for a whole host of social problems, including homelessness, mental illness, drug dependency and school discipline. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There is now growing consensus that in too many places, the only response we have made available to these challenges is arrest and incarceration as opposed to evidence-based, alternative interventions. There is real reform taking place on these broader criminal justice issues right now.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 For these reasons, we should be optimistic about this moment. The public is engaged and there is an opportunity for real progress. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 What is the work ahead? At the Civil Rights Division, we have redoubled our efforts to ensure that policing is done in accordance with the Constitution and to help local \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  departments and the communities they serve build trust where it has eroded.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 We can and do prosecute individual \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  for intentional misconduct. In fact, we have prosecuted nearly 400 law enforcement \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  over just the last six years for constitutional violations. This includes our joint prosecution with the Chicago U.S. Attorney's Office of former Chicago \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Department Commander Jon Burge in 2010 on perjury and obstruction charges, relating to the torture and abuse of detainees in the 1980s. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Criminal prosecution, however, is only one tool, and a limited one at that. We also engage in systemic reform of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  departments, like in Ferguson and Cleveland. Since the start of the administration, the Division has opened 22 investigations into \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  departments. We have also entered into 17 agreements with law enforcement agencies, including consent decrees in New Orleans; Puerto Rico; Seattle; Portland, Oregon; Detroit; the Virgin Islands; East Haven, Connecticut; Warren, Ohio; Albuquerque, New Mexico; and Los Angeles. The department currently has eight open investigations. In the majority of these investigations the Division has issued findings or technical assistance letters. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 As discussed above, the Division is often invited into communities with the support of elected officials, law enforcement, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  unions and communities. Working together with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and community members, we are helping to change the way \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  services are delivered, to reduce the use of unnecessary force and to combat the influence of racial and ethnic bias in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  decision making. We call the last five years of our work in this area "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Reform 2.0" because we learned a lot from the first 15 years of enforcement and we have incorporated lessons learned from that first decade and a half into our more recent efforts. "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Reform 2.0" entails exhaustive engagement with the community through individual interviews and town hall meetings. We meet with local officials and civil rights leaders. We learn from law enforcement leaders. And we spend a lot of time speaking with line \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers and with police unions\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Too often, they tell us that they lack adequate support, training, policy guidance, supervision and even equipment to keep them safe and allow them to engage in constitutional policing that keeps them and the public safe. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Even after we announce our findings, we continue intensive engagement with all of the various stakeholders, including community leaders, line \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers and police unions\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to help shape the remedies that we negotiate at arm's length with city officials. In Ferguson, we have met with several community groups and held an open community forum to learn how area residents wanted to see their \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  department and court system change. Several weeks ago, our attorneys facilitated small group discussions, standing at oversized notepads with marker in hand, taking down the groups' ideas. In our view, this is how reform starts. The stakeholders must feel investment in the remedies laid out in our agreements for them to be successful and sustainable. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Through this inclusive approach to reform, we have identified certain elements that are absolutely required to build trust and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  legitimacy where they have eroded. For example, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  commanders must create opportunities for line \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to have positive interactions, outside of the enforcement context, with individuals they may encounter as victims, witnesses or subjects. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This is a fundamental component of community policing. Departments must also commit to transparency, because the more communities know about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  activity, the more operations can reflect community values and priorities. Structured community engagement is vital - there are a host of models for that and I know you will be having a panel about civilian oversight. We need better research and data. There is a lot we don't know that we should, so thoughtful data collection and analysis is a priority.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There must be fair, consistent and robust internal and external systems of accountability so that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  departments can course correct when problems are identified. Improper bias - both explicit and implicit bias - must be identified and corrected. Critically, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  must be given the specialized training to do their jobs consistent with community values and the professional support to cope with stress and trauma they encounter on the job. They need training to ensure de-escalation with the mentally ill and others in crisis, as well as to ensure respectful interactions with LGBTI, immigrants with language barriers and other vulnerable populations. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 And procedural justice matters. Research shows that being treated fairly and respectfully matters more than the ultimate result of a person's interaction with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 We build these concepts into all of our consent decrees.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Over the past three years, the Division has successfully concluded the implementation of three consent decrees, as well as a memorandum of agreement. Most recently, on May 11, 2015, the Division and the U.S. Attorney's Office announced that the Missoula, Montana, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Department had fully implemented the requirements of its agreement with the department to improve its response to reports of sexual assault. The Missoula \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Department's successful implementation of the agreement in just two years illustrates the power of government, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and community leaders working together to create change that makes law enforcement and communities safer and stronger. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Civil Rights Division is trying to address problems in policing from every angle. For example, our Educational Opportunities Section is working to disrupt the school-to-prison pipeline by intervening where school discipline practices are overly punitive and disproportionately enforced against students of color. Our Employment Litigation Section has brought suits around the country to end discrimination in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  hiring. And our Federal Coordination and Compliance Section is working to ensure that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and court services are available to those with limited English proficiency. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The department, and indeed the President, are committed to these issues, as well. The President recently highlighted several initiatives designed to rebuild trust between \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  departments and the communities they serve. He received the final report from his landmark White House Task Force on 21st Century Policing. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He highlighted an open data project where technologists, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  associations, and community organizations will use data and technology to reduce use of force and increase transparency, and he highlighted the recently created body worn camera toolkit. And he announced the launch of the law enforcement equipment review of federal programs that support acquisitions of equipment by state, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In March, former Attorney General Holder announced the six pilot cities for the new National Initiative for Building Community Trust and Justice, an innovative $4.75 million program designed to enhance procedural justice, reduce bias and support reconciliation between communities and law enforcement. Attorney General Lynch is dedicated to continuing the department's commitment to these issues. She recently launched a national tour promoting community policing and announced $163 million in grant money available to advance the recommendations of the White House Task Force on 21st Century Policing.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Importantly, we know that our reform work must go beyond the mechanics of good policing. We as a society must address the inequality and unfairness that pervade the larger criminal justice system. Often, an encounter with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is only the first contact in a process that involves prosecutors, defense attorneys, courts, correctional institutions and community supervision. Individuals experience these as facets of a unitary system, not as individual institutions. We cannot merely focus on reforming \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  tactics without focusing on transforming broader criminal justice laws and priorities.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 That's why the Department of Justice has expanded its efforts in these other areas in recent years. Through the Smart on Crime Initiative, former Attorney General Holder instructed prosecutors to exercise their discretion to avoid charging low-level drug offenders with mandatory minimum sentences, resulting in the first drop in the federal prison population in 32 years, with no resulting increase in crime. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Along with the Access to Justice Initiative, the Civil Rights Division has advocated for increased resources for state public defense systems and for reform of local courts and jails that imprison individuals who are too poor to afford their fines. And we have brought a record number of suits to address conditions in America's jails and prisons, including the use of solitary confinement on juveniles and those with mental illness. Only by addressing the criminal justice system as a whole will be build the lasting trust between \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and the communities that most need their services.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 So that's a small window into what we're doing in the policing and criminal justice areas. Ultimately, change requires commitment and work at the local level - through persistent and authentic engagement between law enforcement and the communities they serve. That is one of the reasons that we work so closely with U.S. Attorneys around the country and here in Chicago. The U.S. Attorneys provide essential expertise and knowledge to the Division as we address similar issues in sometimes very different communities. Zachary Fardon and his staff are crucial partners to the Civil Rights Division in this work.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Before I leave, let me be clear about something: We can accomplish the sweeping reform I have discussed. In Portland, Oregon, for example, two and a half years after we identified an institutional pattern of excessive force against people with mental illness, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are being retrained, accountability measures implemented and the incidence of using force has dropped dramatically. And in East Haven, Connecticut, residents are seeing transformative change in their \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  department just two years after the entry of a consent decree with the Justice Department. There is reason to be optimistic and believe that we can achieve reform that will keep individuals, communities and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  safe and ensure that communities have fair, impartial and constitutional policing. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There is undoubtedly much work to be done, but law enforcement and communities alike feel the urgency right now. The commitment of the Civil Rights Division, U.S. Attorneys and the Justice Department is part of this work, as is commitment by attorneys and local bar associations. Criminal justice reform at legislatures and city councils is part of this work. And strong law enforcement leadership throughout the country is part of this work. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Beyond the federal government and the legal community, there are concrete roles for people committed to improving \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -community relations, enabling racial reconciliation and promoting justice. It may seem trite but it is powerful when local communities and law enforcement engage directly and constructively with each other, when local leaders have relationships with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  chiefs, when we can understand each others' perspectives, each others' lives. This is hard, unsung work, but it's essential. And there's a role here for anyone who wants a safer, fairer, more equal society.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There is no problem too intractable or impossible for people committed to justice. Justice requires hope and hard, persistent work. We cannot sit idly by and hope that the public attention these issues are receiving will diminish, because they won't, or at least not for long. And so I thank you for your work and for your commitment to justice. Thank you.

\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  BODY:
\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Department of Justice has issued the following news release: 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Thank you, Steve [Edwards, Executive Director of the Institute of Politics], for inviting me here today.  It's an honor to speak with you about the work of the Civil Rights Division, particularly our work to ensure that policing is done in accordance with the Constitution and to help local \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  departments and the communities they serve build trust where it has eroded.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Eric Garner.  Tamir Rice.  John Crawford.  Walter Scott.  Freddie Gray.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 These names and many others have become familiar to us under tragic circumstances in recent months. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Their \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 deaths\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and those of other unarmed African-American men and women in encounters with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have provoked widespread responses across the country and have fueled the Black Lives Matter movement.  In communities of color, in particular, the reaction has been stark and sobering. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In the seven months I have been at the Civil Rights Division, I have spent a lot of time with local leaders and community members in cities all across America, including with numerous mothers who have lost their children in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -involved shootings.  The pain, anger, frustration--the lack of trust in the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 --is real, and it is profound.  Again and again, people have told me that young people are losing faith in our justice system and view law enforcement as preying on them rather than protecting their loved ones.  They talk about how the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  don't value their rights, or indeed, their lives.  They talk about being tired of being viewed as criminals first, human beings second.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The conversation in these rooms, however, is not about whether to have \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  or not, but about what kind of policing communities want and deserve. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There is no question that we need \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in our communities.  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ensure the safety of our communities by patrolling neighborhoods, defending the rights of victims and deterring crime.  They are our first responders in many emergency situations.  And they can be role models for our young people.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The overwhelming majority of the women and men who \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  our streets do their jobs with honor, pride and distinction.  Most of these individuals are driven to the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  academy out of a commitment to public service and a desire to make an impact in their communities.  As we are reminded by the senseless and tragic assassinations of New York \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Department (NYPD) Detectives Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu in December, the shooting of two \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Ferguson in March, and the tragic injuries inflicted on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Baltimore a few weeks ago, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  do all of this at considerable risk to themselves.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 I am struck everywhere I go by the wide gap in empathy and common language to discuss these problems.  Because in the very same cities and rooms where I speak with folks in the community, I hear from law enforcement who emphasize their responsibility to enforce the law and how they are doing the best job they can.  They feel attacked and undervalued.  They talk about how the actions of a few bad actors have tarnished the whole profession.  They talk about the fact that department budgets have been slashed over the last several years, resulting in drastic cuts for community policing and neighborhood patrols.  They point out that they are constantly making split second decisions and people don't account for the thousands of times situations don't escalate.  They talk about how the daily stress of their jobs takes a toll.  And they are right about all of this.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Despite these divergent themes, there is one commonality in all rooms I am in.  And that is that everyone agrees that we are confronting grave challenges when it comes to the erosion of trust between \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and the communities they serve throughout the United States.  The level of mistrust and resentment is unsettling.  Some, including NYPD Commissioner William Bratton, call it a "crisis."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The consequences of distrust between law enforcement and the communities they serve can be devastating.  Where people perceive the criminal justice system to be arbitrary, biased and unfair, they are less likely to cooperate with law enforcement, making us all less safe.  The distrust and alienation experienced in some communities can build into a powder keg of resentment, ready to be ignited by a single tragic incident.  We have seen this over and over--in Watts in 1965, in Los Angeles in 1992 and most recently, in Ferguson in 2014.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It's worth asking, first, how did we get here?  And second, what are we going to do about it? 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Let's start with the first question and consider the source of the mistrust.  Mistrust can't be explained away as the kneejerk reaction of the ill-informed or the hyperbolic.  It has many sources.  For some people, it's in part the product of historical awareness about the role that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  played, as Commissioner Bratton recently told a group of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in "slavery, Reconstruction, Jim Crow, lynchings, blockbusting."  FBI Director James Comey has likewise noted, "At many points in American history, law enforcement enforced the status quo, a status quo that was often brutally unfair to disfavored groups."  As Commissioner Bratton explained, this history has an enduring effect.  "None of us did these things," he told his audience of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0   "None of us were troopers on the bridge at Selma.  But it doesn't matter that these things happened before many of us were even born.  What matters is that our history follows us like a second shadow."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The mistrust is also the product of lived experience, of negative interactions that individuals - or their family members, friends or neighbors - have had with law enforcement.  Something as quietly humiliating as being mistreated during a traffic stop, or being followed in a retail store.  These stories can circulate through a neighborhood - or these days, across the nation via the web and social media - and they can build up over time into a painful narrative that divides community members and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The lack of trust also undeniably results from our criminal justice policies over the last few decades, and the concentrated impact they have had on communities of color and people living in poverty.  Law enforcement practices such as the stopping and frisking of young black men based on stereotypes.  Sentencing policies that result in mass incarceration, particularly of people of color.  And the devastating consequences that convictions have had on individuals' ability to find work, secure stable housing and reintegrate as full members of society.  We bear the responsibility to confront these consequences and reevaluate our approach to criminal justice.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Civil Rights Division's investigation and March 2015 report on the Ferguson \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Department (FPD) speaks to much of what I have been talking about.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In Ferguson, we found a community where unlawful \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  practices created an intensely charged atmosphere where people feel under siege by those charged to serve and protect them. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 We determined that the FPD engages in a pattern or practice of conduct that violates the United States Constitution and federal law.  Specifically, we found that Ferguson PD routinely:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0     Conducts stops without reasonable suspicion and arrests without probable cause, in violation of the Fourth Amendment;
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0     Uses excessive force in violation of the Fourth Amendment;
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0     Unlawfully interferes with First Amendment rights, including the right to record and to protest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  activity;
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0     Impermissibly discriminates against African Americans in violation of the 14th Amendment and federal statutory law; and
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0     Violates due process and equal protection in the operation of its Municipal Court.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 We found that this unconstitutional conduct stems from the interaction of two dynamics: Ferguson's undue focus on revenue generation through policing and pervasive racial bias in the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  department and court system.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 These dynamics fostered unconstitutional practices at nearly every level of Ferguson's law enforcement system.  One example: During the summer of 2012, a Ferguson \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  detained a 32-year-old African-American man who had just finished playing basketball at a park.  The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  approached while the man was sitting in his car, cooling off. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The car's windows appeared to be more heavily tinted than Ferguson's code allowed, so the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  may have had grounds to question him.  But, with no apparent justification, the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  proceeded to escalate the situation, accusing the man of being a pedophile.  He prohibited the man from using his cell phone and ordered him out of his car for a pat-down search, even though he had no reason to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suspect\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  that the man was \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0   And when the man objected - citing his constitutional rights - the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  drew his gun, pointed it at the man's head and arrested him on eight different counts.  The arrest caused the man to lose his job.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 We observed that even minor code violations can sometimes result in multiple arrests, jail time and payments that exceed the cost of the original ticket many times over.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 For example, in 2007, one woman received two parking tickets that - together - totaled $152.  To date, she has paid $550 in fines and fees to the city of Ferguson. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 She's been arrested twice for having unpaid tickets and she has spent six days in jail.  Yet she still - inexplicably - owes Ferguson $541.  Her story is only one of dozens of similar accounts that our investigation uncovered.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In Ferguson, we also found evidence of unlawful discrimination.  African Americans make up 67 percent of the population, but from 2012 to 2014, they constituted:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0     85 percent of the people subject to a vehicle stop;
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0     90 percent of people who received a citation; and
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0     93 percent of people arrested.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 And discretionary \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  actions were overwhelmingly concentrated on the black population.  To take just one example, 95 percent of "manner of walking in roadway" charges - that's jaywalking - were levied against African Americans.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 We found racial disparities in virtually every available metric.  From 2012 to 2014, African Americans were more than twice as likely as white drivers to be searched during vehicle stops, but 26 percent less likely to be found in possession of contraband.  In 88 percent of cases in which FPD documented the use of force, force was used against African Americans.  In all cases in which canines were used against subjects for whom racial information is available, the subject was African-American.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The evidence of racial bias comes not only from statistics, but also from remarks made by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and court supervisors in disturbing email messages.  The emails were incontrovertible evidence of a culture infected by racial bias.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 These findings reveal that the public trust in Ferguson law enforcement and its criminal justice system, especially among African Americans, was damaged long before August 2014.  When there is this level of broad community distrust, public safety suffers and the job of delivering \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  services is rendered more difficult and more dangerous.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In many ways, Ferguson is not an anomaly.  We know from our work around the country that some of the same \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and court practices that we identified in Ferguson - and the same deficit of trust between \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and communities - exist in many other places.  Local officials recognize this, as well.  I know of several \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  chiefs around the country who have assigned the report as required reading for their \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0   And in light of the report, cities around the country are beginning to re-examine their policing and municipal court practices.  Undoubtedly, there is much more work to do, but there's also much to be hopeful about.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In many communities, thoughtful \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and city leaders are working to re-prioritize community policing and rebuild community trust.  Take Cleveland.  Mayor Frank Jackson asked the Civil Rights Division to investigate the Cleveland Division of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  (CDP) in March 2013. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In December 2014, we announced the results of our investigation, concluding that Cleveland \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  engage in a pattern or practice of unreasonable and unnecessary force, including deadly force such as shootings and head strikes with impact weapons.  We also found that the pattern of excessive force had eroded public confidence in the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Thanks to the commitment of Mayor Jackson, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Chief Calvin Williams, the city's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  unions and community members, we entered into a negotiated reform agreement a mere five months after issuing our initial report.  The agreement takes the form of a consent decree that will be independently monitored and enforceable in court.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It's a truly innovative and comprehensive agreement.  It addresses \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  needs by requiring CDP to develop an Equipment and Resource Plan to ensure that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have the equipment they need - such as computers and safe vehicles - to do their jobs safely.  It calls for additional training and an effective employee assistance program to give \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ready access to mental health and support resources. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It sets up a new Community \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Commission - made up of 10 civilian representatives from across the city and one member from each of the city's three \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  unions - that will work with the Division of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to improve community policing, bias-free policing and transparency.  Through this body, the Cleveland community will play a central role in the development of many important \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 polices,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  including those related to use of force and search and seizure.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The agreement also calls for:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0     A civilian head of Internal Affairs, to ensure that internal investigations of misconduct are impartial and reliable;
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0     Specialized training in interacting with persons in mental health crisis, and a Mental Health Response Advisory Committee to foster relationships between the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  the community and mental health providers;
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0     Revised use-of-force policies and training that will require \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to use de-escalation techniques, rather than force, wherever possible;
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0     Strengthened reporting and supervision requirements, along with broad data collection; and
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0     Many other provisions aimed at promoting public safety and building trust between the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and the community.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Cleveland agreement reflects a commitment by the City and the Division of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to work with the Cleveland community to transform this \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  agency into a model of community-oriented policing.  The agreement also demonstrates that people can come together across perceived differences to realize a common vision of a safer, more just city.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Baltimore is another city in which local officials are stepping up to tackle longstanding divisions and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -community divisions.  Last month, Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake asked us to investigate the Baltimore \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Department for a pattern or practice of civil rights violations. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 That same day, the City's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  commissioner and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  union released statements agreeing with the Mayor's request and welcoming our involvement.  Gene Ryan, President of the Baltimore City Fraternal Order of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Lodge No. 3, released a statement stating that the union intends to "fully cooperate with any investigation that has the potential to correct departmental deficiencies and improve the morale of our members . . . As the labor union that represents the nearly 3,000 active duty members of the agency, we agree with (the) Mayor on her invitation to the Department of Justice and welcome their investigation fully as we, too, have issues with many of the current policies and procedures of the department."  After considering the relevant factors, we accepted the City's invitation and opened an investigation.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Wherever this investigation may lead - we don't know what we'll find, and we will never prejudge any outcome - our goal is to work with the community, public officials, law enforcement \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  unions to help build a stronger, better Baltimore. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 As events in both Cleveland and Baltimore show, the commitment of all of these local actors is essential if we are to move forward.  To restore trust where it has been badly eroded.  To promote healing - and address problems that are common to so many great cities across America.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 I said there were two questions - what the sources of mistrust are and what we are going to do about it.  The second question is hard, but we have an unprecedented opportunity now to address fundamental problems in the way communities across the country interact with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and with the criminal justice system more generally. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 While the Civil Rights Division and others in this room and beyond have been working on policing issues for many years, the nation is paying attention because communities are demanding it.  The reality is we tend to confront systemic problems only when forced to by seemingly extraordinary events. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Journalists now are doing impressive investigative reporting on excessive force, racial profiling and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -community relations.  Universities are doing important research and analysis of these problems.  And families are talking about them at the dinner table.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Importantly, the focus on policing issues is happening in a broader conversation about the need to reform our criminal justice system.  There is no question, and I speak from personal experience, that 15 years ago, criminal justice reform was a lonely endeavor.  Few on the Left or the Right were willing to champion its cause.  Today, there is a widespread, even bipartisan, recognition that our criminal justice system needs an overhaul that it should not be the go-to answer for social problems and that mass incarceration has damaged this country in countless ways.  Law enforcement leaders themselves talk about how they have become first responders for a whole host of social problems, including homelessness, mental illness, drug dependency and school discipline. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There is now growing consensus that in too many places, the only response we have made available to these challenges is arrest and incarceration as opposed to evidence-based, alternative interventions.  There is real reform taking place on these broader criminal justice issues right now.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 For these reasons, we should be optimistic about this moment.  The public is engaged and there is an opportunity for real progress. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 What is the work ahead?  At the Civil Rights Division, we have redoubled our efforts to ensure that policing is done in accordance with the Constitution and to help local \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  departments and the communities they serve build trust where it has eroded.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 We can and do prosecute individual \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  for intentional misconduct.  In fact, we have prosecuted nearly 400 law enforcement \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  over just the last six years for constitutional violations.   This includes our joint prosecution with the Chicago U.S. Attorney's Office of former Chicago \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Department Commander Jon Burge in 2010 on perjury and obstruction charges, relating to the torture and abuse of detainees in the 1980s.                         
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Criminal prosecution, however, is only one tool, and a limited one at that.  We also engage in systemic reform of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  departments, like in Ferguson and Cleveland.  Since the start of the administration, the Division has opened 22 investigations into \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  departments.  We have also entered into 17 agreements with law enforcement agencies, including consent decrees in New Orleans; Puerto Rico; Seattle; Portland, Oregon; Detroit; the Virgin Islands; East Haven,  Connecticut; Warren, Ohio; Albuquerque, New Mexico; and Los Angeles.  The department currently has eight open investigations.  In the majority of these investigations the Division has issued findings or technical assistance letters. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 As discussed above, the Division is often invited into communities with the support of elected officials, law enforcement, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  unions and communities.  Working together with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and community members, we are helping to change the way \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  services are delivered, to reduce the use of unnecessary force and to combat the influence of racial and ethnic bias in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  decision making.  We call the last five years of our work in this area "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Reform 2.0" because we learned a lot from the first 15 years of enforcement and we have incorporated lessons learned from that first decade and a half into our more recent efforts.  "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Reform 2.0" entails exhaustive engagement with the community through individual interviews and town hall meetings.  We meet with local officials and civil rights leaders.  We learn from law enforcement leaders.  And we spend a lot of time speaking with line \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers and with police unions\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .  Too often, they tell us that they lack adequate support, training, policy guidance, supervision and even equipment to keep them safe and allow them to engage in constitutional policing that keeps them and the public safe. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Even after we announce our findings, we continue intensive engagement with all of the various stakeholders, including community leaders, line \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers and police unions\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to help shape the remedies that we negotiate at arm's length with city officials.  In Ferguson, we have met with several community groups and held an open community forum to learn how area residents wanted to see their \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  department and court system change.  Several weeks ago, our attorneys facilitated small group discussions, standing at oversized notepads with marker in hand, taking down the groups' ideas.  In our view, this is how reform starts.  The stakeholders must feel investment in the remedies laid out in our agreements for them to be successful and sustainable. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Through this inclusive approach to reform, we have identified certain elements that are absolutely required to build trust and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  legitimacy where they have eroded.  For example, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  commanders must create opportunities for line \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to have positive interactions, outside of the enforcement context, with individuals they may encounter as victims, witnesses or subjects. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This is a fundamental component of community policing.  Departments must also commit to transparency, because the more communities know about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  activity, the more operations can reflect community values and priorities.  Structured community engagement is vital - there are a host of models for that and I know you will be having a panel about civilian oversight.  We need better research and data.  There is a lot we don't know that we should, so thoughtful data collection and analysis is a priority.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There must be fair, consistent and robust internal and external systems of accountability so that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  departments can course correct when problems are identified.  Improper bias - both explicit and implicit bias - must be identified and corrected.  Critically, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  must be given the specialized training to do their jobs consistent with community values and the professional support to cope with stress and trauma they encounter on the job.  They need training to ensure de-escalation with the mentally ill and others in crisis, as well as to ensure respectful interactions with LGBTI, immigrants with language barriers and other vulnerable populations. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 And procedural justice matters.  Research shows that being treated fairly and respectfully matters more than the ultimate result of a person's interaction with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 We build these concepts into all of our consent decrees.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Over the past three years, the Division has successfully concluded the implementation of three consent decrees, as well as a memorandum of agreement.  Most recently, on May 11, 2015, the Division and the U.S. Attorney's Office announced that the Missoula, Montana, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Department had fully implemented the requirements of its agreement with the department to improve its response to reports of sexual assault.  The Missoula \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Department's successful implementation of the agreement in just two years illustrates the power of government, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and community leaders working together to create change that makes law enforcement and communities safer and stronger. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Civil Rights Division is trying to address problems in policing from every angle.  For example, our Educational Opportunities Section is working to disrupt the school-to-prison pipeline by intervening where school discipline practices are overly punitive and disproportionately enforced against students of color.  Our Employment Litigation Section has brought suits around the country to end discrimination in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  hiring.  And our Federal Coordination and Compliance Section is working to ensure that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and court services are available to those with limited English proficiency. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The department, and indeed the President, are committed to these issues, as well. The President recently highlighted several initiatives designed to rebuild trust between \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  departments and the communities they serve.  He received the final report from his landmark White House Task Force on 21st Century Policing.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He highlighted an open data project where technologists, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  associations, and community organizations will use data and technology to reduce use of force and increase transparency, and he highlighted the recently created body worn camera toolkit.  And he announced the launch of the law enforcement equipment review of federal programs that support acquisitions of equipment by state, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In March, former Attorney General Holder announced the six pilot cities for the new National Initiative for Building Community Trust and Justice, an innovative $4.75 million program designed to enhance procedural justice, reduce bias and support reconciliation between communities and law enforcement.  Attorney General Lynch is dedicated to continuing the department's commitment to these issues.  She recently launched a national tour promoting community policing and announced $163 million in grant money available to advance the recommendations of the White House Task Force on 21st Century Policing.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Importantly, we know that our reform work must go beyond the mechanics of good policing.  We as a society must address the inequality and unfairness that pervade the larger criminal justice system.  Often, an encounter with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is only the first contact in a process that involves prosecutors, defense attorneys, courts, correctional institutions and community supervision.  Individuals experience these as facets of a unitary system, not as individual institutions.  We cannot merely focus on reforming \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  tactics without focusing on transforming broader criminal justice laws and priorities.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 That's why the Department of Justice has expanded its efforts in these other areas in recent years.  Through the Smart on Crime Initiative, former Attorney General Holder instructed prosecutors to exercise their discretion to avoid charging low-level drug offenders with mandatory minimum sentences, resulting in the first drop in the federal prison population in 32 years, with no resulting increase in crime. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Along with the Access to Justice Initiative, the Civil Rights Division has advocated for increased resources for state public defense systems and for reform of local courts and jails that imprison individuals who are too poor to afford their fines.  And we have brought a record number of suits to address conditions in America's jails and prisons, including the use of solitary confinement on juveniles and those with mental illness.  Only by addressing the criminal justice system as a whole will be build the lasting trust between \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and the communities that most need their services.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 So that's a small window into what we're doing in the policing and criminal justice areas.  Ultimately, change requires commitment and work at the local level - through persistent and authentic engagement between law enforcement and the communities they serve.  That is one of the reasons that we work so closely with U.S. Attorneys around the country and here in Chicago.  The U.S. Attorneys provide essential expertise and knowledge to the Division as we address similar issues in sometimes very different communities. Zachary Fardon and his staff are crucial partners to the Civil Rights Division in this work.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Before I leave, let me be clear about something:  We can accomplish the sweeping reform I have discussed.  In Portland, Oregon, for example, two and a half years after we identified an institutional pattern of excessive force against people with mental illness, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are being retrained, accountability measures implemented and the incidence of using force has dropped dramatically.  And in East Haven, Connecticut, residents are seeing transformative change in their \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  department just two years after the entry of a consent decree with the Justice Department.  There is reason to be optimistic and believe that we can achieve reform that will keep individuals, communities and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  safe and ensure that communities have fair, impartial and constitutional policing.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There is undoubtedly much work to be done, but law enforcement and communities alike feel the urgency right now.   The commitment of the Civil Rights Division, U.S. Attorneys and the Justice Department is part of this work, as is commitment by attorneys and local bar associations.  Criminal justice reform at legislatures and city councils is part of this work.  And strong law enforcement leadership throughout the country is part of this work. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Beyond the federal government and the legal community, there are concrete roles for people committed to improving \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -community relations, enabling racial reconciliation and promoting justice.  It may seem trite but it is powerful when local communities and law enforcement engage directly and constructively with each other, when local leaders have relationships with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  chiefs, when we can understand each others' perspectives, each others' lives.  This is hard, unsung work, but it's essential.  And there's a role here for anyone who wants a safer, fairer, more equal society.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There is no problem too intractable or impossible for people committed to justice.  Justice requires hope and hard, persistent work.  We cannot sit idly by and hope that the public attention these issues are receiving will diminish, because they won't, or at least not for long.  And so I thank you for your work and for your commitment to justice.  Thank you.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A car backfires in the streets of Cleveland, Ohio. Nearby \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  think it's gunfire. Thus begins the November 2012 chase. Sixty \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cruisers race at 160 kilometres per hour for more than 20 minutes until they corner the car. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  fire 137 rounds. One white \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Michael Brelo, jumps on the hood and fires his Glock 17 pistol 49 times at driver Timothy Russell and passenger Malissa Williams \'e2[#x20ac]" unarmed African-Americans with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  records. Both are killed.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 No one knows for sure how many civilians are killed every year by US \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  or die in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  custody. The website Killed by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has logged 474 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 deaths\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  so far this year, an average of three per day so far in 2015. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Washington Post last month examined 385 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 deaths\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  gunshot and found 80 per cent of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 victims had been armed\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  with lethal weapons. Half were white, half black. Sixteen per cent \'e2[#x20ac]" or 62 of the dead \'e2[#x20ac]" were unarmed people, two-thirds of them black or Hispanics.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Blacks make up only 13 per cent of the US population.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nearly a year since the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  killings of two unarmed black males \'e2[#x20ac]" Eric Garner in New York City in July, and teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri in August \'e2[#x20ac]" questions about excessive use of force by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and racial bias have provoked not only angry riots over Brown's and other killings but also soul-searching in the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  community.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Sometimes it seems like our young \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  want to get into an athletic event with people they want to arrest," said Dallas, Texas, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  chief David Brown, an African-American, at a recent symposium of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  chiefs organised by the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Executive Research Forum (PERF).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 'Don't retreat' mentality
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "They have a 'don't retreat' mentality. They feel like they're warriors, and they can't back down when someone is running from them, no matter how minor the underlying crime is," he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Over decades, the US Supreme Court has reduced \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  authority.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  must now inform suspects of their right to an attorney before questioning, and may not use deadly force in a chase unless the suspect threatens "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  or serious physical injury to the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  or others".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 These days, bystanders with cell phone cameras, the post-9/11expansion of security cameras and social media have created a new round of scrutiny on how \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  behave.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Last year in Canada, which also grapples with the issue, 22 cameras filmed the actions of a Toronto \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as he used three shots to down a mentally disturbed, knife-wielding Syrian man \'e2[#x20ac]" then fired another six shots into the prone body.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  advocates worry that the high profile films, protests and riots after the killing of Brown, Freddie Gray in Baltimore, Garner and others have demonised \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and threatened their lives.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  being targeted
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 At least 54 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have died in the course of duty this year so far, and at least five are believed to have been targeted killings.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Eugene O'Donnell, an ex-New York \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice at the City University of New York, condemned the "great smearing" of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in his tribute to a New York \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  recently felled by assault.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Cops today find themselves challenged during routine calls, cameras thrust in their faces, accused of discriminatory treatment by many," he wrote.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But others in the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  community are equally worried about the killings of suspects, and are calling for changes in the way \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are prepared for duty.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Yes, they might be shooting too many people, but that's a training issue more than a race issue ... We blame cops for things that aren't their fault \'e2[#x20ac]" society's racism, or how they are trained," says Peter Moskos, a former Baltimore \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  who teaches at the local John Jay College of Criminal Justice.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In fact, three of the six Baltimore \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  charged in the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of Freddie Gray in April are black, challenging the notion that excessive force is just a white-on-black issue.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Experts say training needs to include preparation for how to disengage, de-escalate and step back, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  chiefs and advocates say. Training needs to give permission to back off when circumstances allow, said Cassandra Deck-Brown, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  chief in Raleigh, North Carolina and an African-American, at the PERF symposium.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The concept of community policing has pushed more \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  back to walking the beat, getting to know the people they are charged with protecting. For Moskos and others, the push has largely succeeded and cops are using less force now than they did 20 and 30 years ago, even if it seems otherwise in social media.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nonetheless, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  \'e2[#x20ac]" whether black or white \'e2[#x20ac]" tend to be conservative, and the people who are doing the firearms training "are often the most militaristic and conservative" of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  trainers, Moskos said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It's the mentality side of those conservative trainers that then gets passed down to cops, and that's not necessarily good," he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The public is rightfully upset."

One white \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Michael Brelo, jumps on the hood and fires his Glock 17 pistol 49 times at driver Timothy Russell and passenger Malissa Williams \'e2[#x20ac]" unarmed African-Americans with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  records. Both are killed.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 No one knows for sure how many civilians are killed every year by US \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  or die in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  custody. The website Killed by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has logged 474 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 deaths\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  so far this year, an average of three per day so far in 2015. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Washington Post last month examined 385 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 deaths\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  gunshot and found 80 per cent of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 victims had been armed\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  with lethal weapons. Half were white, half black. Sixteen per cent \'e2[#x20ac]" or 62 of the dead \'e2[#x20ac]" were unarmed people, two-thirds of them black or Hispanics.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Blacks make up only 13 per cent of the US population.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nearly a year since the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  killings of two unarmed black males \'e2[#x20ac]" Eric Garner in New York City in July, and teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri in August \'e2[#x20ac]" questions about excessive use of force by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and racial bias have provoked not only angry riots over Brown's and other killings but also soul-searching in the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  community.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Sometimes it seems like our young \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  want to get into an athletic event with people they want to arrest," said Dallas, Texas, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  chief David Brown, an African-American, at a recent symposium of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  chiefs organised by the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Executive Research Forum (PERF).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 'Don't retreat' mentality
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "They have a 'don't retreat' mentality. They feel like they're warriors, and they can't back down when someone is running from them, no matter how minor the underlying crime is," he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Over decades, the US Supreme Court has reduced \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  authority.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  must now inform suspects of their right to an attorney before questioning, and may not use deadly force in a chase unless the suspect threatens "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  or serious physical injury to the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  or others".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 These days, bystanders with cell phone cameras, the post-9/11expansion of security cameras and social media have created a new round of scrutiny on how \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  behave.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Last year in Canada, which also grapples with the issue, 22 cameras filmed the actions of a Toronto \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as he used three shots to down a mentally disturbed, knife-wielding Syrian man \'e2[#x20ac]" then fired another six shots into the prone body.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  advocates worry that the high profile films, protests and riots after the killing of Brown, Freddie Gray in Baltimore, Garner and others have demonised \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and threatened their lives.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  being targeted
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 At least 54 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have died in the course of duty this year so far, and at least five are believed to have been targeted killings.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Eugene O'Donnell, an ex-New York \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice at the City University of New York, condemned the "great smearing" of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in his tribute to a New York \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  recently felled by assault.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Cops today find themselves challenged during routine calls, cameras thrust in their faces, accused of discriminatory treatment by many," he wrote.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But others in the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  community are equally worried about the killings of suspects, and are calling for changes in the way \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are prepared for duty.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Yes, they might be shooting too many people, but that's a training issue more than a race issue ... We blame cops for things that aren't their fault \'e2[#x20ac]" society's racism, or how they are trained," says Peter Moskos, a former Baltimore \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  who teaches at the local John Jay College of Criminal Justice.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In fact, three of the six Baltimore \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  charged in the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of Freddie Gray in April are black, challenging the notion that excessive force is just a white-on-black issue.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Experts say training needs to include preparation for how to disengage, de-escalate and step back, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  chiefs and advocates say. Training needs to give permission to back off when circumstances allow, said Cassandra Deck-Brown, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  chief in Raleigh, North Carolina and an African-American, at the PERF symposium.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The concept of community policing has pushed more \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  back to walking the beat, getting to know the people they are charged with protecting. For Moskos and others, the push has largely succeeded and cops are using less force now than they did 20 and 30 years ago, even if it seems otherwise in social media.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nonetheless, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  \'e2[#x20ac]" whether black or white \'e2[#x20ac]" tend to be conservative, and the people who are doing the firearms training "are often the most militaristic and conservative" of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  trainers, Moskos said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It's the mentality side of those conservative trainers that then gets passed down to cops, and that's not necessarily good," he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The public is rightfully upset."

\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 SAN JOSE -- A San Jose \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has been cleared in the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 fatal\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shooting of a bipolar 19-year-old woman during an August encounter in which she walked outside with a cordless power drill painted black, which \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  thought might be a machine gun.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Prosecutors announced Thursday that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Wakana Okuma, a 13-year veteran, acted lawfully when she fired a single shot from her AR-15 rifle at Diana Showman the morning of Aug. 14 in front of her father's South San Jose home, on Blossom Hill Road near Playa del Rey. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Okuma believed the drill was a firearm and thought she was going to be killed by Showman," the Santa Clara County District Attorney's Office states in its \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -involved shooting report.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Showman's parents have repeatedly challenged that contention, saying their daughter might not have taken her medication for bipolar disorder that morning and was not a threat. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have said that the emergency call in which she claimed to be armed and made threats against her family forced their response.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The family filed a claim against the city of San Jose in February to preserve their right to file a lawsuit and seek damages, and are pushing for changes in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  training and use of force. Her family believed that after two decades with an affliction that demanded constant attention and an array of medications, independence had become a real possibility for the Leigh High School graduate, an avid softball player and mentor for special-needs children.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The DA's report doesn't change anything for us," said Victoria Showman, Diana's mother. "We're committed for Diana's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to have meaning. This isn't going to stop us."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Okuma, one of the first \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to respond to the scene, was certified in Crisis Intervention Team training and specialized in handling calls involving the mentally ill. But the report states that "because of how quickly the events unfolded, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Okuma did not think that her Crisis Intervention Training came into play."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Steven Clark, an attorney representing the Showman family, challenged that stance. He noted the report's finding that Diana Showman was on the phone with a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  dispatcher for at least 20 minutes before she emerged from the home.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We take strong umbrage with the contention there was not enough time to defuse," Clark said. "This is (the) exact situation where that training can be used."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 If anything, the shooting makes the case for increased and ongoing training, said Jim Showman, Diana's father.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "There's got to be a different outcome," he said. "There is no way Diana's actions justified her life being taken."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 On the morning of the shooting, Diana Showman called 911 and reportedly told emergency dispatchers she had an Uzi and was going to shoot her mother and brother, who she said were locked in a bedroom. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  later learned no one else was home at the time.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and witnesses, Showman exited her home just before 11 a.m. with an item in each hand. She soon dropped one of the items, later identified as the cellphone she used to call 911. But she kept the second item, later revealed to be a cordless drill painted black, in her right hand and walked slowly toward the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  defying their orders to drop it, instead alternating between raising and lowering it. As she got near Okuma -- estimates range from 10 feet to as far as 30 feet -- the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  fired.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Given the appearance of the painted drill and the dispatcher's report that the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suspect\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  claimed to be \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  with an Uzi, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Okuma believed and was reasonable in believing that the drill was some type of firearm," the report stated.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The report states that the drill, which did not have a bit inside, was originally yellow, and investigators suspect Showman spray-painted it black the morning of the shooting. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  found a can of spray paint matching the color of the drill inside the garage.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Victoria Showman wants to see independent panels review \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -involved shootings, and she said she hopes that the national conversation over use of force continues. Clark added that as \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are increasingly relied on to respond to mental health crises -- owing in part to a dearth of public resources available -- \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  must revamp their approach.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Too many \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -involved shootings involve people with mental health challenges. The Showmans want to give a voice to those people. They're speaking for others," Clark said. "They want to see those numbers change."

He noted the report's finding that Diana Showman was on the phone with a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  dispatcher for at least 20 minutes before she emerged from the home.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We take strong umbrage with the contention there was not enough time to defuse," Clark said. "This is (the) exact situation where that training can be used."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 If anything, the shooting makes the case for increased and ongoing training, said Jim Showman, Diana's father.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "There's got to be a different outcome," he said. "There is no way Diana's actions justified her life being taken."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 On the morning of the shooting, Diana Showman called 911 and reportedly told emergency dispatchers she had an Uzi and was going to shoot her mother and brother, who she said were locked in a bedroom. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  later learned no one else was home at the time.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and witnesses, Showman exited her home just before 11 a.m. with an item in each hand. She soon dropped one of the items, later identified as the cellphone she used to call 911. But she kept the second item, later revealed to be a cordless drill painted black, in her right hand and walked slowly toward the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  defying their orders to drop it, instead alternating between raising and lowering it. As she got near Okuma -- estimates range from 10 feet to as far as 30 feet -- the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  fired.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Given the appearance of the painted drill and the dispatcher's report that the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suspect\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  claimed to be \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  with an Uzi, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Okuma believed and was reasonable in believing that the drill was some type of firearm," the report stated.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The report states that the drill, which did not have a bit inside, was originally yellow, and investigators suspect Showman spray-painted it black the morning of the shooting. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  found a can of spray paint matching the color of the drill inside the garage.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Victoria Showman wants to see independent panels review \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -involved shootings, and she said she hopes that the national conversation over use of force continues. Clark added that as \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are increasingly relied on to respond to mental health crises -- owing in part to a dearth of public resources available -- \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  must revamp their approach.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Too many \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -involved shootings involve people with mental health challenges. The Showmans want to give a voice to those people. They're speaking for others," Clark said. "They want to see those numbers change."

\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  BODY:
\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  US Department of Justice, The Government of USA has issued the following news release: 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Thank you to Constance Talmage, John Walsh and the Colorado Lawyers Committee for inviting me here today. It's an honor to speak with you today about the work of the Civil Rights Division, particularly our work to ensure that policing is done in accordance with the Constitution and to help local \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  departments and the communities they serve build trust where it has eroded.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Eric Garner. Michael Brown. Tamir Rice. John Crawford. Walter Scott. Freddie Gray.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 These names and many others have become familiar to us under tragic circumstances in recent months. Their \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 deaths\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and those of other unarmed African American men and women in encounters with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , have provoked widespread responses across the country and have fueled the Black Lives Matter movement. In communities of color, in particular, the reaction has been stark and sobering. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In the seven months I have been at the Civil Rights Division, I have spent a lot of time with local leaders and community members in cities all across America, including with numerous mothers who have lost their children in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -involved shootings. The pain, anger, frustration--the lack of trust in the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 --is real, and it is profound. Again and again, people have told me that young people are losing faith in our justice system and view law enforcement as preying on them rather than protecting their loved ones. They talk about how the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  don't value their rights, or indeed, their lives. They talk about being tired of being viewed as criminals first, human beings second.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The conversation in these rooms, however, is not about whether to have \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  or not but about what kind of policing communities want and deserve. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There is no question that we need \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in our communities. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ensure the safety of our communities by patrolling neighborhoods, defending the rights of victims and deterring crime. They are our first responders in many emergency situations.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The overwhelming majority of the women and men who \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  our streets do their jobs with honor, pride and distinction. Most of these individuals are driven to the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  academy out of a commitment to public service and a desire to make an impact in their communities. As the senseless and tragic assassinations of NYPD \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu this spring, the shooting of two \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Ferguson in March and the tragic injuries inflicted on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Baltimore a few weeks ago, remind us, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  do all of this at considerable risk to themselves.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 I am struck everywhere I go by the wide gap in empathy and common language to discuss these problems. Because in the very same cities and rooms where I speak with folks in the community, I hear from law enforcement who emphasize their responsibility to enforce the law and how they are doing the best job they can. They feel attacked and undervalued. They talk about how the actions of a few bad actors have tarnished the whole profession. They talk about the fact that department budgets have been slashed over the last several years, resulting in drastic cuts for community policing and neighborhood patrols. They talk about how they are constantly making split second decisions and people don't account for the thousands of times situations don't escalate and how the daily stress of their jobs take a toll.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But there is one certain commonality in all rooms I am in. And that is that everyone agrees that we are confronting grave challenges when it comes to the erosion of trust between \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and the communities they serve throughout the United States. The level of mistrust and resentment is unsettling. Some, including NYPD Commissioner William Bratton, call it a "crisis in American policing."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The consequences of distrust between law enforcement and the communities they serve can be devastating. Where people perceive the criminal justice system to be arbitrary, biased and unfair, they are less likely to cooperate with law enforcement, making us all less safe. The distrust and alienation experienced in some communities can build into a powder keg of resentment, ready to be ignited by a single tragic incident. We have seen this over and over--in Watts in 1965, in Los Angeles in 1992 and most recently, in Ferguson in 2014.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It's worth asking, first, how did we get here? And second, what are we going to do about it? 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Let's start with the first question and consider the source of the mistrust. Mistrust can't be explained away as the kneejerk reaction of the ill-informed or the hyperbolic. It's in part the product of historical awareness about the role that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have played in enforcing and perpetuating slavery, the Black Codes, lynchings and Jim Crow segregation. As FBI Director James Comey noted, "At many points in American history, law enforcement enforced the status quo, a status quo that was often brutally unfair to disfavored groups."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It is also the product of lived experience, of negative interactions that individuals -- or their family members, friends, or neighbors -- have had with law enforcement. Something as quietly humiliating as being mistreated during a traffic stop, or being followed in a retail store. These stories can circulate through a neighborhood -- or these days, across the nation via the web and social media -- and they can build up over time into a painful narrative that divides community members and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The lack of trust also undeniably results from our criminal justice policies over the last few decades, and the concentrated impact they have had on communities of color and people living in poverty. Law enforcement practices such as the stopping and frisking of young black men based on stereotypes. Sentencing policies that result in mass incarceration, particularly of people of color. And the devastating consequences that convictions have had on individuals' ability to find work, secure stable housing and reintegrate as full members of society. These are deliberate policy choices that we made over the last several decades. We bear the responsibility to confront their consequences.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Civil Rights Division's investigation and recently released report on the Ferguson \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Department speaks to all of what I have been talking about.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In Ferguson, we found a community where unlawful \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  practices have not only severely undermined the public trust and made local residents less safe - but created an intensely charged atmosphere where people feel under siege by those charged to serve and protect them. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 We determined that the FPD engages in a pattern or practice of conduct that violates the United States Constitution and federal law. Specifically, we found that Ferguson PD routinely:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Conducts stops without reasonable suspicion and arrests without probable cause, in violation of the Fourth Amendment;
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Uses unreasonable force in violation of the Fourth Amendment;
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Unlawfully interferes with First Amendment rights, including the right to record and to protest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  activity;
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Impermissibly discriminates against African Americans in violation of the 14th Amendment and federal statutory law; and
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Violates due process and equal protection in the operation of its Municipal Court.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 We found that this unconstitutional conduct stems from the interaction of two dynamics: Ferguson's undue focus on revenue generation through policing and pervasive racial bias in the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  department and court system.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 These dynamics fostered unconstitutional practices at nearly every level of Ferguson's law enforcement system. One example: During the summer of 2012, a Ferguson \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  detained a 32-year-old African American man who had just finished playing basketball at a park. The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  approached while the man was sitting in his car, cooling off. The car's windows appeared to be more heavily tinted than Ferguson's code allowed, so the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  may have had grounds to question him. But, with no apparent justification, the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  proceeded to escalate the situation, accusing the man of being a pedophile. He prohibited the man from using his cell phone and ordered him out of his car for a pat-down search, even though he had no reason to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suspect\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  that the man was \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  And when the man objected - citing his constitutional rights - the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  drew his gun, pointed it at the man's head and arrested him on eight different counts. The arrest caused the man to lose his job.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 We observed that even minor code violations can sometimes result in multiple arrests, jail time and payments that exceed the cost of the original ticket many times over.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 For example, in 2007, one woman received two parking tickets that - together - totaled $152. To date, she has paid $550 in fines and fees to the city of Ferguson. She's been arrested twice for having unpaid tickets and she has spent six days in jail. Yet she still - inexplicably - owes Ferguson $541. Her story is only one of dozens of similar accounts that our investigation uncovered.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 By exposing the harm that the Ferguson court system causes, our findings report contributes to a growing understanding of a significant problem in our criminal justice system: the economic exploitation of the poor. The use of modern-day debtors' prisons, the outsourcing of supervision to private probation companies, the imposition of fees on defendants to avail themselves of court-appointed attorneys and the right to a jury trial--these are dangerous trends that should concern us all.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In Ferguson, we also found evidence of unlawful discrimination. African Americans make up 67% of the population, but from 2012 to 2014, they constituted:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  85% of the people subject to a vehicle stop;
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  90% of people who received a citation; and
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  93% of people arrested.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 And discretionary \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  actions were overwhelmingly concentrated on the black population. To take just one example, 95% of "manner of walking in roadway" charges--that's jaywalking--were levied against African Americans.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 We found racial disparities in virtually every available metric. From 2012 to 2014, African Americans were more than twice as likely as white drivers to be searched during vehicle stops, but 26% less likely to be found in possession of contraband. In 88% of cases in which FPD documented the use of force, force was used against African Americans. In all cases in which canines were used against subjects for whom racial information is available, the subject was African American.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The evidence of racial bias comes not only from statistics, but also from remarks made by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  city and court officials. Some of you may be aware of the emails we discovered during our investigation. The emails were incontrovertible evidence of a culture that tolerated and perhaps even celebrated racial bias.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 These findings reveal that the public trust in Ferguson law enforcement and its criminal justice system, especially among African Americans, was damaged long before August 2014. When there is this level of broad community distrust, public safety suffers and the job of delivering \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  services is rendered more difficult and more dangerous.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Although we do not know what we will uncover in future investigations - and will never prejudge any outcome - in the weeks ahead, we pledge to bring the same rigor, the same fairness and the same impartiality to Baltimore, where the Division has launched a civil investigation into the Baltimore \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Department.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Wherever this investigation may lead, our goal is to work with the community, public officials and law enforcement to help build a stronger, better Baltimore. To restore trust where it has been badly eroded. To promote healing - and address problems that are common to so many great cities across America.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In many ways, Ferguson is not an anomaly. Through our work around the country, we know there are similar \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and court practices in many places. I also know of several \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  chiefs around the country that assigned the report as required reading for their \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  We are already seeing the force multiplying effect of the report. In the days subsequent to the issuance of our report, cities around the country are beginning to re-examine their policing and municipal court practices, though we know there is much more work to do. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 I said there were two questions--what the sources of mistrust are and what we are going to do about it. The second question is hard but we have an unprecedented opportunity now to address fundamental problems in the way communities across the country interact with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and with the criminal justice system more generally. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 While the Civil Rights Division and others in this room and beyond have been working on policing issues for many years, the nation is paying attention because communities are demanding it. The reality is we tend to confront systemic problems only when forced to by seemingly extraordinary events. Journalists now are doing impressive investigative reporting on excessive force, racial profiling and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -community relations. Universities are doing important research and analysis of these problems. And families are talking about them at the dinner table.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Importantly, the focus on policing issues is happening in a broader conversation about the need to reform our criminal justice system. There is no question, and I speak from personal experience, that 15 years ago, criminal justice reform was a lonely endeavor. Few on the Left or the Right were willing to champion its cause. Today, there is a widespread, even bipartisan, recognition that our criminal justice system needs an overhaul, that it should not be the go to answer for social problems and that mass incarceration has damaged this country in countless ways. Law enforcement leaders themselves talk about how they have become first responders for a whole host of social problems, including homelessness, mental illness, drug dependency, school discipline. And in too many places, the only response we have made available to them is arrest and incarceration as opposed to evidence-based, alternative interventions. There is real reform taking place on broader criminal justice issues right now.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 For these reasons, we should be optimistic about this moment. The public is engaged and there is an opportunity for real progress. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 What is the work ahead? At the Civil Rights Division, we have redoubled our efforts to ensure that policing is done in accordance with the Constitution and to help local \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  departments and the communities they serve build trust where it has eroded.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 We can and do prosecute individual \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  for intentional misconduct. In fact, we have prosecuted nearly 400 law enforcement \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  over just the last six years for constitutional violations. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Criminal prosecution, however, is only one tool, and a limited one at that. We also engage in systemic reform of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  departments, like in Ferguson. Since the start of the administration, the Division has opened 22 investigations into \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  departments, including most recently the Baltimore City \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Department. We also are currently enforcing 16 agreements with law enforcement agencies, including consent decrees in New Orleans, Puerto Rico, Seattle, Portland (Oregon), Detroit, the Virgin Islands, East Haven (Connecticut), Warren (Ohio), Albuquerque and Los Angeles. The department currently has nine open investigations. In the majority of these investigations the Division has issued findings or technical assistance letters. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The division is often invited into communities with the support of elected officials, law enforcement, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  unions and communities. For example, two weeks ago, Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake invited the division to conduct a review of the Baltimore \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Department. In response to the Mayor's request, Gene Ryan, president of the Baltimore City Fraternal Order of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Lodge No. 3, released a statement, saying the union intends to "fully cooperate with any investigation that has the potential to correct departmental deficiencies and improve the morale of our members . . . As the labor union that represents the nearly 3,000 active duty members of the agency, we agree with (the) mayor on her invitation to the Department of Justice and welcome their investigation fully as we, too, have issues with many of the current policies and procedures of the department."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Working together with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and community members, we are helping to change the way \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  services are delivered, to reduce the use of unnecessary force and to combat the influence of racial and ethnic bias in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  decision making. We call the last five years of our work in this area "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Reform 2.0" because we learned a lot from the first 15 years of enforcement and we have incorporated lessons learned from that first decade and a half into our more recent efforts. "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Reform 2.0" entails exhaustive engagement with the community through individual interviews and town hall meetings. We meet with local officials and civil rights leaders. We learn from law enforcement leaders. And we spend a lot of time speaking with line \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers and with police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  unions. Too often, they tell us that they lack adequate support, training, policy guidance, supervision and even equipment to keep them safe and allow them to engage in constitutional policing that keeps them and the public safe. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Even after we announce our findings, we continue intensive engagement with all of the various stakeholders, including community leaders, line \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers and police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  unions to help shape the remedies that we negotiate at arm's length with city officials. In Ferguson, we have met with several community groups and held an open community forum to learn how area residents wanted to see their \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  department and court system change. Several weeks ago, our attorneys facilitated small group discussions, standing with an oversized notepad with marker in hand, taking down the groups' ideas. In our view, this is how reform starts. The stakeholders must feel investment in the remedies laid out in our agreements for them to be successful and sustainable. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Through this inclusive approach to reform, we have identified certain elements that are absolutely required to build trust and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  legitimacy where they have eroded. For example, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  commanders must create opportunities for line \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to have positive interactions, outside of the enforcement context, with individuals they may encounter as victims, witnesses, or subjects. This is a fundamental component of community policing. Departments must also commit to transparency, because the more communities know about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  activity, the more operations can reflect community values and priorities. Structured community engagement is vital - there are a host of models for that and I know you will be having a panel about civilian oversight. We need better research and data. There is a lot we don't know that we should, so thoughtful data collection and analysis is a priority.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There must be fair, consistent and robust internal and external systems of accountability so that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  departments can course correct when problems are identified. Improper bias -- both explicit and implicit bias -- must be identified and corrected. Critically, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  must be given the specialized training to do their jobs consistent with community values and the professional support to cope with stress and trauma they encounter on the job. They need training to ensure de-escalation with the mentally ill and others in crisis, as well as to ensure respectful interactions with LGBTI, immigrants with language barriers and other vulnerable populations. And procedural justice matters. Research shows that being treated fairly and respectfully matters more than the ultimate result of a person's interaction with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 We build these concepts into all of our consent decrees.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Over the past three years, the division has successfully concluded the implementation of three consent decrees, as well as a memorandum of agreement. Most recently, on May 11, 2015, the division and the U.S. Attorney's Office announced that the Missoula, Montana, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Department had fully implemented the requirements of its agreement with the department to improve the its response to reports of sexual assault. The Missoula \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Department's successful implementation of the agreement in just two years illustrates the power of government, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and community leaders working together to create change that makes law enforcement and communities safer and stronger. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Civil Rights Division is also trying to address problems in policing from every angle. For example, our Educational Opportunities Section is working to disrupt the school-to-prison pipeline by intervening where school discipline practices are overly punitive and disproportionately enforced against students of color. Our Employment Litigation Section has brought suits around the country to end discrimination in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  hiring. And our Federal Coordination and Compliance Section is working to ensure that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and court services are available to those with limited English proficiency. For example, attorneys in FCS have worked with the U.S. Attorney's Office here in Colorado to secure a voluntary settlement agreement with the Supreme Court of Colorado to expand language assistance in court proceedings and programs. As a result of this case, limited English proficient persons throughout the state are entitled to interpreter or other language assistance so that they are able to participate meaningfully in all court matters. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The department, and indeed the President, are committed to these issues, as well. The President yesterday highlighted several initiatives designed to rebuild trust between \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  departments and the communities they serve. He received the final report from his landmark White House Task Force on 21st Century Policing. He highlighted an open data project where technologists, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  associations, and community organizations will use data and technology to reduce use of force and increase transparency and he highlighted the recently created body worn camera toolkit. And he announced the launch of the law enforcement equipment review of federal programs that support acquisitions of equipment by state, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies. In March, former Attorney General Holder announced the six pilot cities for the new National Initiative for Building Community Trust and Justice, an innovative program designed to enhance procedural justice, reduce bias and support reconciliation between communities and law enforcement. Attorney General Lynch is dedicated to continuing the department's commitment to these issues. Today she is in Cincinnati launching a national tour promoting community policing and $163million in grant money available to advance the recommendations of the White House Task Force on 21st Century Policing.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 On the local level, U.S. Attorney's Offices--including yours--have been meeting with law enforcement \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to promote community policing and anti-bias initiatives. Here in Colorado, U.S. Attorney John Walsh has emphasized the need for outreach to refugee communities as well as the importance of outreach to communities to prevent gang violence.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Importantly, we know that our reform work must go beyond the mechanics of good policing. We as a society must address the inequality and unfairness that pervade the larger criminal justice system. Often, an encounter with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is only the first contact in a process that involves prosecutors, defense attorneys, courts, correctional institutions and community supervision. Individuals experience these as facets of a unitary system, not as individual institutions. We cannot merely focus on reforming \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  tactics without focusing on transforming broader criminal justice laws and priorities.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 That's why the Department of Justice has expanded its efforts in these other areas in recent years. Through the Smart on Crime Initiative, former Attorney General Holder instructed prosecutors to exercise their discretion to avoid charging low-level drug offenders with mandatory minimum sentences, resulting in the first drop in the federal prison population in 32 years, with no resulting increase in crime. U.S. Attorneys like John Walsh are at the forefront of the Department's Smart on Crime Initiative. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Along with the Access to Justice Initiative, the Civil Rights Division has advocated for increased resources for state public defense systems and for reform of local courts and jails that imprison individuals who are too poor to afford their fines. And we have brought a record number of suits to address conditions in America's jails and prisons, including the use of solitary confinement on juveniles and those with mental illness. Only by addressing the criminal justice system as a whole will be build the lasting trust between \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and the communities that most need their services.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 So that's a small window into what we're doing in the policing and criminal justice areas. Ultimately, change requires commitment and work at the local level - through persistent and authentic engagement between law enforcement and the communities they serve. That is one of the reasons that we work so closely with U.S. Attorneys around the country and here in Denver. The U.S. Attorneys provide essential expertise and knowledge to the Division as we address similar issues in sometimes very different communities. John Walsh and his staff are crucial partners to the Civil Rights Division in this work.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 I would be remiss if I did not also tell you that John Walsh and his staff are crucial partners for the Civil Rights Division in civil rights matters beyond policing and criminal justice. John's staff has long collaborated with the division on a range of civil rights matters, most notably enforcement of the Americans with Disabilities Act. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Before I leave, let me be clear about something: We can accomplish the sweeping reform I have discussed. In Portland, Oregon, for example, two and a half years after we identified an institutional pattern of excessive force against people with mental illness, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are being retrained, accountability measures implemented and the incidence of using force has dropped dramatically. And right next door in East Haven, Connecticut, residents are seeing transformative change in their \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  department just two years after the entry of a consent decree with the Justice Department. There is reason to be optimistic and believe that we can achieve reform that will keep individuals, communities and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  safe and ensure that communities have fair, impartial and constitutional policing. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There is undoubtedly much work to be done but law enforcement and communities alike feel the urgency right now. The commitment of the Civil Rights Division, U.S. Attorneys and the Justice Department is part of this work, as is commitment by attorneys and local bar associations. Criminal justice reform at legislatures and city councils is part of this work. Strong law enforcement leadership throughout the country is part of this work. And the hard, authentic dialogue in communities all over the country with law enforcement is part of the work. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Beyond the federal government and the legal community, there are concrete roles for people committed to improving \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -community relations, enabling racial reconciliation and promoting justice. It may seem trite but it is powerful when local communities and law enforcement engage directly and constructively with each other, when local leaders have relationships with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  chiefs, when we can understand each others' perspectives, each others' lives. This is hard, inglorious work, but it's essential. And there's a role here for anyone who wants a safer, fairer, more equal society.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There is no problem too intractable or impossible for people committed to justice. Justice requires hope and hard, persistent work. We cannot sit idly by and hope that the public attention these issues are receiving will diminish, because they won't, or at least not for long. And so I thank you for your work and for your commitment to justice. Thank you.

\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  BODY:
\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Department of Justice has issued the following news release: 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Thank you to Constance Talmage, John Walsh and the Colorado Lawyers Committee for inviting me here today.  It's an honor to speak with you today about the work of the Civil Rights Division, particularly our work to ensure that policing is done in accordance with the Constitution and to help local \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  departments and the communities they serve build trust where it has eroded.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Eric Garner.  Michael Brown.  Tamir Rice.  John Crawford.  Walter Scott. Freddie Gray.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 These names and many others have become familiar to us under tragic circumstances in recent months.  Their \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 deaths\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and those of other unarmed African American men and women in encounters with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , have provoked widespread responses across the country and have fueled the Black Lives Matter movement.  In communities of color, in particular, the reaction has been stark and sobering. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In the seven months I have been at the Civil Rights Division, I have spent a lot of time with local leaders and community members in cities all across America, including with numerous mothers who have lost their children in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -involved shootings.  The pain, anger, frustration--the lack of trust in the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 --is real, and it is profound.  Again and again, people have told me that young people are losing faith in our justice system and view law enforcement as preying on them rather than protecting their loved ones.  They talk about how the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  don't value their rights, or indeed, their lives.  They talk about being tired of being viewed as criminals first, human beings second.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The conversation in these rooms, however, is not about whether to have \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  or not but about what kind of policing communities want and deserve. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There is no question that we need \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in our communities.  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ensure the safety of our communities by patrolling neighborhoods, defending the rights of victims and deterring crime.  They are our first responders in many emergency situations.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The overwhelming majority of the women and men who \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  our streets do their jobs with honor, pride and distinction.  Most of these individuals are driven to the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  academy out of a commitment to public service and a desire to make an impact in their communities.  As the senseless and tragic assassinations of NYPD \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu this spring, the shooting of two \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Ferguson in March and the tragic injuries inflicted on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Baltimore a few weeks ago, remind us, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  do all of this at considerable risk to themselves.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 I am struck everywhere I go by the wide gap in empathy and common language to discuss these problems.  Because in the very same cities and rooms where I speak with folks in the community, I hear from law enforcement who emphasize their responsibility to enforce the law and how they are doing the best job they can.  They feel attacked and undervalued.  They talk about how the actions of a few bad actors have tarnished the whole profession.  They talk about the fact that department budgets have been slashed over the last several years, resulting in drastic cuts for community policing and neighborhood patrols.  They talk about how they are constantly making split second decisions and people don't account for the thousands of times situations don't escalate and how the daily stress of their jobs take a toll.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But there is one certain commonality in all rooms I am in.  And that is that everyone agrees that we are confronting grave challenges when it comes to the erosion of trust between \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and the communities they serve throughout the United States.  The level of mistrust and resentment is unsettling.  Some, including NYPD Commissioner William Bratton, call it a "crisis in American policing."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The consequences of distrust between law enforcement and the communities they serve can be devastating.  Where people perceive the criminal justice system to be arbitrary, biased and unfair, they are less likely to cooperate with law enforcement, making us all less safe.  The distrust and alienation experienced in some communities can build into a powder keg of resentment, ready to be ignited by a single tragic incident.  We have seen this over and over--in Watts in 1965, in Los Angeles in 1992 and most recently, in Ferguson in 2014.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It's worth asking, first, how did we get here?  And second, what are we going to do about it? 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Let's start with the first question and consider the source of the mistrust.  Mistrust can't be explained away as the kneejerk reaction of the ill-informed or the hyperbolic.  It's in part the product of historical awareness about the role that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have played in enforcing and perpetuating slavery, the Black Codes, lynchings and Jim Crow segregation.  As FBI Director James Comey noted, "At many points in American history, law enforcement enforced the status quo, a status quo that was often brutally unfair to disfavored groups."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It is also the product of lived experience, of negative interactions that individuals -- or their family members, friends, or neighbors -- have had with law enforcement.  Something as quietly humiliating as being mistreated during a traffic stop, or being followed in a retail store.  These stories can circulate through a neighborhood -- or these days, across the nation via the web and social media -- and they can build up over time into a painful narrative that divides community members and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The lack of trust also undeniably results from our criminal justice policies over the last few decades, and the concentrated impact they have had on communities of color and people living in poverty.  Law enforcement practices such as the stopping and frisking of young black men based on stereotypes.  Sentencing policies that result in mass incarceration, particularly of people of color.  And the devastating consequences that convictions have had on individuals' ability to find work, secure stable housing and reintegrate as full members of society.  These are deliberate policy choices that we made over the last several decades.  We bear the responsibility to confront their consequences.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Civil Rights Division's investigation and recently released report on the Ferguson \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Department speaks to all of what I have been talking about.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In Ferguson, we found a community where unlawful \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  practices have not only severely undermined the public trust and made local residents less safe - but created an intensely charged atmosphere where people feel under siege by those charged to serve and protect them. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 We determined that the FPD engages in a pattern or practice of conduct that violates the United States Constitution and federal law.  Specifically, we found that Ferguson PD routinely:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0     Conducts stops without reasonable suspicion and arrests without probable cause, in violation of the Fourth Amendment;
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0     Uses unreasonable force in violation of the Fourth Amendment;
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0     Unlawfully interferes with First Amendment rights, including the right to record and to protest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  activity;
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0     Impermissibly discriminates against African Americans in violation of the 14th Amendment and federal statutory law; and
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0     Violates due process and equal protection in the operation of its Municipal Court.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 We found that this unconstitutional conduct stems from the interaction of two dynamics:  Ferguson's undue focus on revenue generation through policing and pervasive racial bias in the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  department and court system.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 These dynamics fostered unconstitutional practices at nearly every level of Ferguson's law enforcement system.  One example: During the summer of 2012, a Ferguson \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  detained a 32-year-old African American man who had just finished playing basketball at a park.  The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  approached while the man was sitting in his car, cooling off.  The car's windows appeared to be more heavily tinted than Ferguson's code allowed, so the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  may have had grounds to question him.  But, with no apparent justification, the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  proceeded to escalate the situation, accusing the man of being a pedophile.  He prohibited the man from using his cell phone and ordered him out of his car for a pat-down search, even though he had no reason to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suspect\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  that the man was \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0   And when the man objected - citing his constitutional rights - the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  drew his gun, pointed it at the man's head and arrested him on eight different counts.  The arrest caused the man to lose his job.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 We observed that even minor code violations can sometimes result in multiple arrests, jail time and payments that exceed the cost of the original ticket many times over.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 For example, in 2007, one woman received two parking tickets that - together - totaled $152.  To date, she has paid $550 in fines and fees to the city of Ferguson.  She's been arrested twice for having unpaid tickets and she has spent six days in jail.  Yet she still - inexplicably - owes Ferguson $541.  Her story is only one of dozens of similar accounts that our investigation uncovered.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 By exposing the harm that the Ferguson court system causes, our findings report contributes to a growing understanding of a significant problem in our criminal justice system: the economic exploitation of the poor.  The use of modern-day debtors' prisons, the outsourcing of supervision to private probation companies, the imposition of fees on defendants to avail themselves of court-appointed attorneys and the right to a jury trial--these are dangerous trends that should concern us all.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In Ferguson, we also found evidence of unlawful discrimination.  African Americans make up 67% of the population, but from 2012 to 2014, they constituted:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0     85% of the people subject to a vehicle stop;
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0     90% of people who received a citation; and
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0     93% of people arrested.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 And discretionary \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  actions were overwhelmingly concentrated on the black population.  To take just one example, 95% of "manner of walking in roadway" charges--that's jaywalking--were levied against African Americans.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 We found racial disparities in virtually every available metric.  From 2012 to 2014, African Americans were more than twice as likely as white drivers to be searched during vehicle stops, but 26% less likely to be found in possession of contraband.  In 88% of cases in which FPD documented the use of force, force was used against African Americans.  In all cases in which canines were used against subjects for whom racial information is available, the subject was African American.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The evidence of racial bias comes not only from statistics, but also from remarks made by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  city and court officials.  Some of you may be aware of the emails we discovered during our investigation.  The emails were incontrovertible evidence of a culture that tolerated and perhaps even celebrated racial bias.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 These findings reveal that the public trust in Ferguson law enforcement and its criminal justice system, especially among African Americans, was damaged long before August 2014.  When there is this level of broad community distrust, public safety suffers and the job of delivering \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  services is rendered more difficult and more dangerous.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Although we do not know what we will uncover in future investigations - and will never prejudge any outcome - in the weeks ahead, we pledge to bring the same rigor, the same fairness and the same impartiality to Baltimore, where the Division has launched a civil investigation into the Baltimore \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Department.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Wherever this investigation may lead, our goal is to work with the community, public officials and law enforcement to help build a stronger, better Baltimore.  To restore trust where it has been badly eroded.  To promote healing - and address problems that are common to so many great cities across America.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In many ways, Ferguson is not an anomaly.  Through our work around the country, we know there are similar \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and court practices in many places.  I also know of several \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  chiefs around the country that assigned the report as required reading for their \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0   We are already seeing the force multiplying effect of the report.  In the days subsequent to the issuance of our report, cities around the country are beginning to re-examine their policing and municipal court practices, though we know there is much more work to do.                 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 I said there were two questions--what the sources of mistrust are and what we are going to do about it.  The second question is hard but we have an unprecedented opportunity now to address fundamental problems in the way communities across the country interact with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and with the criminal justice system more generally. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 While the Civil Rights Division and others in this room and beyond have been working on policing issues for many years, the nation is paying attention because communities are demanding it.  The reality is we tend to confront systemic problems only when forced to by seemingly extraordinary events.  Journalists now are doing impressive investigative reporting on excessive force, racial profiling and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -community relations.  Universities are doing important research and analysis of these problems.  And families are talking about them at the dinner table.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Importantly, the focus on policing issues is happening in a broader conversation about the need to reform our criminal justice system.  There is no question, and I speak from personal experience, that 15 years ago, criminal justice reform was a lonely endeavor.  Few on the Left or the Right were willing to champion its cause.  Today, there is a widespread, even bipartisan, recognition that our criminal justice system needs an overhaul, that it should not be the go to answer for social problems and that mass incarceration has damaged this country in countless ways.  Law enforcement leaders themselves talk about how they have become first responders for a whole host of social problems, including homelessness, mental illness, drug dependency, school discipline.  And in too many places, the only response we have made available to them is arrest and incarceration as opposed to evidence-based, alternative interventions.  There is real reform taking place on broader criminal justice issues right now.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 For these reasons, we should be optimistic about this moment.  The public is engaged and there is an opportunity for real progress. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 What is the work ahead?  At the Civil Rights Division, we have redoubled our efforts to ensure that policing is done in accordance with the Constitution and to help local \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  departments and the communities they serve build trust where it has eroded.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 We can and do prosecute individual \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  for intentional misconduct.  In fact, we have prosecuted nearly 400 law enforcement \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  over just the last six years for constitutional violations.                                                                                                           
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Criminal prosecution, however, is only one tool, and a limited one at that.  We also engage in systemic reform of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  departments, like in Ferguson.  Since the start of the administration, the Division has opened 22 investigations into \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  departments, including most recently the Baltimore City \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Department.  We also are currently enforcing 16 agreements with law enforcement agencies, including consent decrees in New Orleans, Puerto Rico, Seattle, Portland (Oregon), Detroit, the Virgin Islands, East Haven (Connecticut), Warren (Ohio), Albuquerque and Los Angeles.  The department currently has nine open investigations. In the majority of these investigations the Division has issued findings or technical assistance letters. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The division is often invited into communities with the support of elected officials, law enforcement, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  unions and communities.  For example, two weeks ago, Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake invited the division to conduct a review of the Baltimore \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Department.  In response to the Mayor's request, Gene Ryan, president of the Baltimore City Fraternal Order of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Lodge No. 3, released a statement, saying the union intends to "fully cooperate with any investigation that has the potential to correct departmental deficiencies and improve the morale of our members . . . As the labor union that represents the nearly 3,000 active duty members of the agency, we agree with (the) mayor on her invitation to the Department of Justice and welcome their investigation fully as we, too, have issues with many of the current policies and procedures of the department."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Working together with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and community members, we are helping to change the way \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  services are delivered, to reduce the use of unnecessary force and to combat the influence of racial and ethnic bias in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  decision making.  We call the last five years of our work in this area "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Reform 2.0" because we learned a lot from the first 15 years of enforcement and we have incorporated lessons learned from that first decade and a half into our more recent efforts.  "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Reform 2.0" entails exhaustive engagement with the community through individual interviews and town hall meetings.  We meet with local officials and civil rights leaders.  We learn from law enforcement leaders.  And we spend a lot of time speaking with line \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers and with police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  unions.  Too often, they tell us that they lack adequate support, training, policy guidance, supervision and even equipment to keep them safe and allow them to engage in constitutional policing that keeps them and the public safe. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Even after we announce our findings, we continue intensive engagement with all of the various stakeholders, including community leaders, line \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers and police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  unions to help shape the remedies that we negotiate at arm's length with city officials.  In Ferguson, we have met with several community groups and held an open community forum to learn how area residents wanted to see their \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  department and court system change.  Several weeks ago, our attorneys facilitated small group discussions, standing with an oversized notepad with marker in hand, taking down the groups' ideas.  In our view, this is how reform starts.  The stakeholders must feel investment in the remedies laid out in our agreements for them to be successful and sustainable. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Through this inclusive approach to reform, we have identified certain elements that are absolutely required to build trust and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  legitimacy where they have eroded.  For example, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  commanders must create opportunities for line \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to have positive interactions, outside of the enforcement context, with individuals they may encounter as victims, witnesses, or subjects.  This is a fundamental component of community policing.  Departments must also commit to transparency, because the more communities know about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  activity, the more operations can reflect community values and priorities.  Structured community engagement is vital - there are a host of models for that and I know you will be having a panel about civilian oversight.  We need better research and data.  There is a lot we don't know that we should, so thoughtful data collection and analysis is a priority.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There must be fair, consistent and robust internal and external systems of accountability so that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  departments can course correct when problems are identified.  Improper bias -- both explicit and implicit bias -- must be identified and corrected.  Critically, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  must be given the specialized training to do their jobs consistent with community values and the professional support to cope with stress and trauma they encounter on the job.  They need training to ensure de-escalation with the mentally ill and others in crisis, as well as to ensure respectful interactions with LGBTI, immigrants with language barriers and other vulnerable populations.  And procedural justice matters.  Research shows that being treated fairly and respectfully matters more than the ultimate result of a person's interaction with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 We build these concepts into all of our consent decrees.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Over the past three years, the division has successfully concluded the implementation of three consent decrees, as well as a memorandum of agreement.  Most recently, on May 11, 2015, the division and the U.S. Attorney's Office announced that the Missoula, Montana, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Department had fully implemented the requirements of its agreement with the department to improve the its response to reports of sexual assault.  The Missoula \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Department's successful implementation of the agreement in just two years illustrates the power of government, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and community leaders working together to create change that makes law enforcement and communities safer and stronger. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Civil Rights Division is also trying to address problems in policing from every angle.  For example, our Educational Opportunities Section is working to disrupt the school-to-prison pipeline by intervening where school discipline practices are overly punitive and disproportionately enforced against students of color.  Our Employment Litigation Section has brought suits around the country to end discrimination in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  hiring.  And our Federal Coordination and Compliance Section is working to ensure that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and court services are available to those with limited English proficiency.  For example, attorneys in FCS have worked with the U.S. Attorney's Office here in Colorado to secure a voluntary settlement agreement with the Supreme Court of Colorado to expand language assistance in court proceedings and programs.  As a result of this case, limited English proficient persons throughout the state are entitled to interpreter or other language assistance so that they are able to participate meaningfully in all court matters.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The department, and indeed the President, are committed to these issues, as well. The President yesterday highlighted several initiatives designed to rebuild trust between \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  departments and the communities they serve. He received the final report from his landmark White House Task Force on 21st Century Policing. He highlighted an open data project where technologists, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  associations, and community organizations will use data and technology to reduce use of force and increase transparency and he highlighted the recently created body worn camera toolkit. And he announced the launch of the law enforcement equipment review of federal programs that support acquisitions of equipment by state, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies.  In March, former Attorney General Holder announced the six pilot cities for the new National Initiative for Building Community Trust and Justice, an innovative program designed to enhance procedural justice, reduce bias and support reconciliation between communities and law enforcement.  Attorney General Lynch is dedicated to continuing the department's commitment to these issues. Today she is in Cincinnati launching a national tour promoting community policing and $163million in grant money available to advance the recommendations of the White House Task Force on 21st Century Policing.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 On the local level, U.S. Attorney's Offices--including yours--have been meeting with law enforcement \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to promote community policing and anti-bias initiatives.  Here in Colorado, U.S. Attorney John Walsh has emphasized the need for outreach to refugee communities as well as the importance of outreach to communities to prevent gang violence.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Importantly, we know that our reform work must go beyond the mechanics of good policing.  We as a society must address the inequality and unfairness that pervade the larger criminal justice system.  Often, an encounter with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is only the first contact in a process that involves prosecutors, defense attorneys, courts, correctional institutions and community supervision.  Individuals experience these as facets of a unitary system, not as individual institutions.  We cannot merely focus on reforming \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  tactics without focusing on transforming broader criminal justice laws and priorities.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 That's why the Department of Justice has expanded its efforts in these other areas in recent years.  Through the Smart on Crime Initiative, former Attorney General Holder instructed prosecutors to exercise their discretion to avoid charging low-level drug offenders with mandatory minimum sentences, resulting in the first drop in the federal prison population in 32 years, with no resulting increase in crime.  U.S. Attorneys like John Walsh are at the forefront of the Department's Smart on Crime Initiative.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Along with the Access to Justice Initiative, the Civil Rights Division has advocated for increased resources for state public defense systems and for reform of local courts and jails that imprison individuals who are too poor to afford their fines.  And we have brought a record number of suits to address conditions in America's jails and prisons, including the use of solitary confinement on juveniles and those with mental illness.  Only by addressing the criminal justice system as a whole will be build the lasting trust between \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and the communities that most need their services.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 So that's a small window into what we're doing in the policing and criminal justice areas.  Ultimately, change requires commitment and work at the local level - through persistent and authentic engagement between law enforcement and the communities they serve.  That is one of the reasons that we work so closely with U.S. Attorneys around the country and here in Denver.  The U.S. Attorneys provide essential expertise and knowledge to the Division as we address similar issues in sometimes very different communities.  John Walsh and his staff are crucial partners to the Civil Rights Division in this work.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 I would be remiss if I did not also tell you that John Walsh and his staff are crucial partners for the Civil Rights Division in civil rights matters beyond policing and criminal justice.  John's staff has long collaborated with the division on a range of civil rights matters, most notably enforcement of the Americans with Disabilities Act. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Before I leave, let me be clear about something:  We can accomplish the sweeping reform I have discussed.  In Portland, Oregon, for example, two and a half years after we identified an institutional pattern of excessive force against people with mental illness, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are being retrained, accountability measures implemented and the incidence of using force has dropped dramatically.  And right next door in East Haven, Connecticut, residents are seeing transformative change in their \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  department just two years after the entry of a consent decree with the Justice Department.  There is reason to be optimistic and believe that we can achieve reform that will keep individuals, communities and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  safe and ensure that communities have fair, impartial and constitutional policing.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There is undoubtedly much work to be done but law enforcement and communities alike feel the urgency right now.   The commitment of the Civil Rights Division, U.S. Attorneys and the Justice Department is part of this work, as is commitment by attorneys and local bar associations.  Criminal justice reform at legislatures and city councils is part of this work.  Strong law enforcement leadership throughout the country is part of this work.  And the hard, authentic dialogue in communities all over the country with law enforcement is part of the work.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Beyond the federal government and the legal community, there are concrete roles for people committed to improving \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -community relations, enabling racial reconciliation and promoting justice.  It may seem trite but it is powerful when local communities and law enforcement engage directly and constructively with each other, when local leaders have relationships with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  chiefs, when we can understand each others' perspectives, each others' lives.  This is hard, inglorious work, but it's essential.  And there's a role here for anyone who wants a safer, fairer, more equal society.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There is no problem too intractable or impossible for people committed to justice.  Justice requires hope and hard, persistent work.  We cannot sit idly by and hope that the public attention these issues are receiving will diminish, because they won't, or at least not for long.  And so I thank you for your work and for your commitment to justice.  Thank you.

\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  BODY:
\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  US Department of Justice, The Government of USA has issued the following news release: 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Thank you to Constance Talmage, John Walsh and the Colorado Lawyers Committee for inviting me here today. It's an honor to speak with you today about the work of the Civil Rights Division, particularly our work to ensure that policing is done in accordance with the Constitution and to help local \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  departments and the communities they serve build trust where it has eroded.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Eric Garner. Michael Brown. Tamir Rice. John Crawford. Walter Scott. Freddie Gray.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 These names and many others have become familiar to us under tragic circumstances in recent months. Their \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 deaths\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and those of other unarmed African American men and women in encounters with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , have provoked widespread responses across the country and have fueled the Black Lives Matter movement. In communities of color, in particular, the reaction has been stark and sobering. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In the seven months I have been at the Civil Rights Division, I have spent a lot of time with local leaders and community members in cities all across America, including with numerous mothers who have lost their children in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -involved shootings. The pain, anger, frustration--the lack of trust in the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 --is real, and it is profound. Again and again, people have told me that young people are losing faith in our justice system and view law enforcement as preying on them rather than protecting their loved ones. They talk about how the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  don't value their rights, or indeed, their lives. They talk about being tired of being viewed as criminals first, human beings second.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The conversation in these rooms, however, is not about whether to have \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  or not but about what kind of policing communities want and deserve. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There is no question that we need \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in our communities. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ensure the safety of our communities by patrolling neighborhoods, defending the rights of victims and deterring crime. They are our first responders in many emergency situations.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The overwhelming majority of the women and men who \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  our streets do their jobs with honor, pride and distinction. Most of these individuals are driven to the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  academy out of a commitment to public service and a desire to make an impact in their communities. As the senseless and tragic assassinations of NYPD \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu this spring, the shooting of two \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Ferguson in March and the tragic injuries inflicted on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Baltimore a few weeks ago, remind us, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  do all of this at considerable risk to themselves.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 I am struck everywhere I go by the wide gap in empathy and common language to discuss these problems. Because in the very same cities and rooms where I speak with folks in the community, I hear from law enforcement who emphasize their responsibility to enforce the law and how they are doing the best job they can. They feel attacked and undervalued. They talk about how the actions of a few bad actors have tarnished the whole profession. They talk about the fact that department budgets have been slashed over the last several years, resulting in drastic cuts for community policing and neighborhood patrols. They talk about how they are constantly making split second decisions and people don't account for the thousands of times situations don't escalate and how the daily stress of their jobs take a toll.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But there is one certain commonality in all rooms I am in. And that is that everyone agrees that we are confronting grave challenges when it comes to the erosion of trust between \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and the communities they serve throughout the United States. The level of mistrust and resentment is unsettling. Some, including NYPD Commissioner William Bratton, call it a "crisis in American policing."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The consequences of distrust between law enforcement and the communities they serve can be devastating. Where people perceive the criminal justice system to be arbitrary, biased and unfair, they are less likely to cooperate with law enforcement, making us all less safe. The distrust and alienation experienced in some communities can build into a powder keg of resentment, ready to be ignited by a single tragic incident. We have seen this over and over--in Watts in 1965, in Los Angeles in 1992 and most recently, in Ferguson in 2014.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It's worth asking, first, how did we get here? And second, what are we going to do about it? 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Let's start with the first question and consider the source of the mistrust. Mistrust can't be explained away as the kneejerk reaction of the ill-informed or the hyperbolic. It's in part the product of historical awareness about the role that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have played in enforcing and perpetuating slavery, the Black Codes, lynchings and Jim Crow segregation. As FBI Director James Comey noted, "At many points in American history, law enforcement enforced the status quo, a status quo that was often brutally unfair to disfavored groups."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It is also the product of lived experience, of negative interactions that individuals -- or their family members, friends, or neighbors -- have had with law enforcement. Something as quietly humiliating as being mistreated during a traffic stop, or being followed in a retail store. These stories can circulate through a neighborhood -- or these days, across the nation via the web and social media -- and they can build up over time into a painful narrative that divides community members and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The lack of trust also undeniably results from our criminal justice policies over the last few decades, and the concentrated impact they have had on communities of color and people living in poverty. Law enforcement practices such as the stopping and frisking of young black men based on stereotypes. Sentencing policies that result in mass incarceration, particularly of people of color. And the devastating consequences that convictions have had on individuals' ability to find work, secure stable housing and reintegrate as full members of society. These are deliberate policy choices that we made over the last several decades. We bear the responsibility to confront their consequences.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Civil Rights Division's investigation and recently released report on the Ferguson \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Department speaks to all of what I have been talking about.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In Ferguson, we found a community where unlawful \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  practices have not only severely undermined the public trust and made local residents less safe - but created an intensely charged atmosphere where people feel under siege by those charged to serve and protect them. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 We determined that the FPD engages in a pattern or practice of conduct that violates the United States Constitution and federal law. Specifically, we found that Ferguson PD routinely:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Conducts stops without reasonable suspicion and arrests without probable cause, in violation of the Fourth Amendment;
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Uses unreasonable force in violation of the Fourth Amendment;
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Unlawfully interferes with First Amendment rights, including the right to record and to protest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  activity;
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Impermissibly discriminates against African Americans in violation of the 14th Amendment and federal statutory law; and
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Violates due process and equal protection in the operation of its Municipal Court.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 We found that this unconstitutional conduct stems from the interaction of two dynamics: Ferguson's undue focus on revenue generation through policing and pervasive racial bias in the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  department and court system.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 These dynamics fostered unconstitutional practices at nearly every level of Ferguson's law enforcement system. One example: During the summer of 2012, a Ferguson \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  detained a 32-year-old African American man who had just finished playing basketball at a park. The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  approached while the man was sitting in his car, cooling off. The car's windows appeared to be more heavily tinted than Ferguson's code allowed, so the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  may have had grounds to question him. But, with no apparent justification, the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  proceeded to escalate the situation, accusing the man of being a pedophile. He prohibited the man from using his cell phone and ordered him out of his car for a pat-down search, even though he had no reason to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suspect\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  that the man was \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  And when the man objected - citing his constitutional rights - the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  drew his gun, pointed it at the man's head and arrested him on eight different counts. The arrest caused the man to lose his job.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 We observed that even minor code violations can sometimes result in multiple arrests, jail time and payments that exceed the cost of the original ticket many times over.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 For example, in 2007, one woman received two parking tickets that - together - totaled $152. To date, she has paid $550 in fines and fees to the city of Ferguson. She's been arrested twice for having unpaid tickets and she has spent six days in jail. Yet she still - inexplicably - owes Ferguson $541. Her story is only one of dozens of similar accounts that our investigation uncovered.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 By exposing the harm that the Ferguson court system causes, our findings report contributes to a growing understanding of a significant problem in our criminal justice system: the economic exploitation of the poor. The use of modern-day debtors' prisons, the outsourcing of supervision to private probation companies, the imposition of fees on defendants to avail themselves of court-appointed attorneys and the right to a jury trial--these are dangerous trends that should concern us all.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In Ferguson, we also found evidence of unlawful discrimination. African Americans make up 67% of the population, but from 2012 to 2014, they constituted:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  85% of the people subject to a vehicle stop;
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  90% of people who received a citation; and
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  93% of people arrested.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 And discretionary \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  actions were overwhelmingly concentrated on the black population. To take just one example, 95% of "manner of walking in roadway" charges--that's jaywalking--were levied against African Americans.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 We found racial disparities in virtually every available metric. From 2012 to 2014, African Americans were more than twice as likely as white drivers to be searched during vehicle stops, but 26% less likely to be found in possession of contraband. In 88% of cases in which FPD documented the use of force, force was used against African Americans. In all cases in which canines were used against subjects for whom racial information is available, the subject was African American.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The evidence of racial bias comes not only from statistics, but also from remarks made by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  city and court officials. Some of you may be aware of the emails we discovered during our investigation. The emails were incontrovertible evidence of a culture that tolerated and perhaps even celebrated racial bias.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 These findings reveal that the public trust in Ferguson law enforcement and its criminal justice system, especially among African Americans, was damaged long before August 2014. When there is this level of broad community distrust, public safety suffers and the job of delivering \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  services is rendered more difficult and more dangerous.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Although we do not know what we will uncover in future investigations - and will never prejudge any outcome - in the weeks ahead, we pledge to bring the same rigor, the same fairness and the same impartiality to Baltimore, where the Division has launched a civil investigation into the Baltimore \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Department.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Wherever this investigation may lead, our goal is to work with the community, public officials and law enforcement to help build a stronger, better Baltimore. To restore trust where it has been badly eroded. To promote healing - and address problems that are common to so many great cities across America.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In many ways, Ferguson is not an anomaly. Through our work around the country, we know there are similar \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and court practices in many places. I also know of several \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  chiefs around the country that assigned the report as required reading for their \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  We are already seeing the force multiplying effect of the report. In the days subsequent to the issuance of our report, cities around the country are beginning to re-examine their policing and municipal court practices, though we know there is much more work to do. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 I said there were two questions--what the sources of mistrust are and what we are going to do about it. The second question is hard but we have an unprecedented opportunity now to address fundamental problems in the way communities across the country interact with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and with the criminal justice system more generally. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 While the Civil Rights Division and others in this room and beyond have been working on policing issues for many years, the nation is paying attention because communities are demanding it. The reality is we tend to confront systemic problems only when forced to by seemingly extraordinary events. Journalists now are doing impressive investigative reporting on excessive force, racial profiling and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -community relations. Universities are doing important research and analysis of these problems. And families are talking about them at the dinner table.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Importantly, the focus on policing issues is happening in a broader conversation about the need to reform our criminal justice system. There is no question, and I speak from personal experience, that 15 years ago, criminal justice reform was a lonely endeavor. Few on the Left or the Right were willing to champion its cause. Today, there is a widespread, even bipartisan, recognition that our criminal justice system needs an overhaul, that it should not be the go to answer for social problems and that mass incarceration has damaged this country in countless ways. Law enforcement leaders themselves talk about how they have become first responders for a whole host of social problems, including homelessness, mental illness, drug dependency, school discipline. And in too many places, the only response we have made available to them is arrest and incarceration as opposed to evidence-based, alternative interventions. There is real reform taking place on broader criminal justice issues right now.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 For these reasons, we should be optimistic about this moment. The public is engaged and there is an opportunity for real progress. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 What is the work ahead? At the Civil Rights Division, we have redoubled our efforts to ensure that policing is done in accordance with the Constitution and to help local \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  departments and the communities they serve build trust where it has eroded.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 We can and do prosecute individual \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  for intentional misconduct. In fact, we have prosecuted nearly 400 law enforcement \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  over just the last six years for constitutional violations. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Criminal prosecution, however, is only one tool, and a limited one at that. We also engage in systemic reform of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  departments, like in Ferguson. Since the start of the administration, the Division has opened 22 investigations into \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  departments, including most recently the Baltimore City \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Department. We also are currently enforcing 16 agreements with law enforcement agencies, including consent decrees in New Orleans, Puerto Rico, Seattle, Portland (Oregon), Detroit, the Virgin Islands, East Haven (Connecticut), Warren (Ohio), Albuquerque and Los Angeles. The department currently has nine open investigations. In the majority of these investigations the Division has issued findings or technical assistance letters. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The division is often invited into communities with the support of elected officials, law enforcement, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  unions and communities. For example, two weeks ago, Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake invited the division to conduct a review of the Baltimore \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Department. In response to the Mayor's request, Gene Ryan, president of the Baltimore City Fraternal Order of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Lodge No. 3, released a statement, saying the union intends to "fully cooperate with any investigation that has the potential to correct departmental deficiencies and improve the morale of our members . . . As the labor union that represents the nearly 3,000 active duty members of the agency, we agree with (the) mayor on her invitation to the Department of Justice and welcome their investigation fully as we, too, have issues with many of the current policies and procedures of the department."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Working together with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and community members, we are helping to change the way \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  services are delivered, to reduce the use of unnecessary force and to combat the influence of racial and ethnic bias in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  decision making. We call the last five years of our work in this area "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Reform 2.0" because we learned a lot from the first 15 years of enforcement and we have incorporated lessons learned from that first decade and a half into our more recent efforts. "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Reform 2.0" entails exhaustive engagement with the community through individual interviews and town hall meetings. We meet with local officials and civil rights leaders. We learn from law enforcement leaders. And we spend a lot of time speaking with line \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers and with police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  unions. Too often, they tell us that they lack adequate support, training, policy guidance, supervision and even equipment to keep them safe and allow them to engage in constitutional policing that keeps them and the public safe. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Even after we announce our findings, we continue intensive engagement with all of the various stakeholders, including community leaders, line \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers and police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  unions to help shape the remedies that we negotiate at arm's length with city officials. In Ferguson, we have met with several community groups and held an open community forum to learn how area residents wanted to see their \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  department and court system change. Several weeks ago, our attorneys facilitated small group discussions, standing with an oversized notepad with marker in hand, taking down the groups' ideas. In our view, this is how reform starts. The stakeholders must feel investment in the remedies laid out in our agreements for them to be successful and sustainable. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Through this inclusive approach to reform, we have identified certain elements that are absolutely required to build trust and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  legitimacy where they have eroded. For example, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  commanders must create opportunities for line \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to have positive interactions, outside of the enforcement context, with individuals they may encounter as victims, witnesses, or subjects. This is a fundamental component of community policing. Departments must also commit to transparency, because the more communities know about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  activity, the more operations can reflect community values and priorities. Structured community engagement is vital - there are a host of models for that and I know you will be having a panel about civilian oversight. We need better research and data. There is a lot we don't know that we should, so thoughtful data collection and analysis is a priority.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There must be fair, consistent and robust internal and external systems of accountability so that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  departments can course correct when problems are identified. Improper bias -- both explicit and implicit bias -- must be identified and corrected. Critically, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  must be given the specialized training to do their jobs consistent with community values and the professional support to cope with stress and trauma they encounter on the job. They need training to ensure de-escalation with the mentally ill and others in crisis, as well as to ensure respectful interactions with LGBTI, immigrants with language barriers and other vulnerable populations. And procedural justice matters. Research shows that being treated fairly and respectfully matters more than the ultimate result of a person's interaction with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 We build these concepts into all of our consent decrees.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Over the past three years, the division has successfully concluded the implementation of three consent decrees, as well as a memorandum of agreement. Most recently, on May 11, 2015, the division and the U.S. Attorney's Office announced that the Missoula, Montana, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Department had fully implemented the requirements of its agreement with the department to improve the its response to reports of sexual assault. The Missoula \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Department's successful implementation of the agreement in just two years illustrates the power of government, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and community leaders working together to create change that makes law enforcement and communities safer and stronger. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Civil Rights Division is also trying to address problems in policing from every angle. For example, our Educational Opportunities Section is working to disrupt the school-to-prison pipeline by intervening where school discipline practices are overly punitive and disproportionately enforced against students of color. Our Employment Litigation Section has brought suits around the country to end discrimination in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  hiring. And our Federal Coordination and Compliance Section is working to ensure that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and court services are available to those with limited English proficiency. For example, attorneys in FCS have worked with the U.S. Attorney's Office here in Colorado to secure a voluntary settlement agreement with the Supreme Court of Colorado to expand language assistance in court proceedings and programs. As a result of this case, limited English proficient persons throughout the state are entitled to interpreter or other language assistance so that they are able to participate meaningfully in all court matters. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The department, and indeed the President, are committed to these issues, as well. The President yesterday highlighted several initiatives designed to rebuild trust between \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  departments and the communities they serve. He received the final report from his landmark White House Task Force on 21st Century Policing. He highlighted an open data project where technologists, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  associations, and community organizations will use data and technology to reduce use of force and increase transparency and he highlighted the recently created body worn camera toolkit. And he announced the launch of the law enforcement equipment review of federal programs that support acquisitions of equipment by state, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies. In March, former Attorney General Holder announced the six pilot cities for the new National Initiative for Building Community Trust and Justice, an innovative program designed to enhance procedural justice, reduce bias and support reconciliation between communities and law enforcement. Attorney General Lynch is dedicated to continuing the department's commitment to these issues. Today she is in Cincinnati launching a national tour promoting community policing and $163million in grant money available to advance the recommendations of the White House Task Force on 21st Century Policing.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 On the local level, U.S. Attorney's Offices--including yours--have been meeting with law enforcement \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to promote community policing and anti-bias initiatives. Here in Colorado, U.S. Attorney John Walsh has emphasized the need for outreach to refugee communities as well as the importance of outreach to communities to prevent gang violence.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Importantly, we know that our reform work must go beyond the mechanics of good policing. We as a society must address the inequality and unfairness that pervade the larger criminal justice system. Often, an encounter with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is only the first contact in a process that involves prosecutors, defense attorneys, courts, correctional institutions and community supervision. Individuals experience these as facets of a unitary system, not as individual institutions. We cannot merely focus on reforming \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  tactics without focusing on transforming broader criminal justice laws and priorities.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 That's why the Department of Justice has expanded its efforts in these other areas in recent years. Through the Smart on Crime Initiative, former Attorney General Holder instructed prosecutors to exercise their discretion to avoid charging low-level drug offenders with mandatory minimum sentences, resulting in the first drop in the federal prison population in 32 years, with no resulting increase in crime. U.S. Attorneys like John Walsh are at the forefront of the Department's Smart on Crime Initiative. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Along with the Access to Justice Initiative, the Civil Rights Division has advocated for increased resources for state public defense systems and for reform of local courts and jails that imprison individuals who are too poor to afford their fines. And we have brought a record number of suits to address conditions in America's jails and prisons, including the use of solitary confinement on juveniles and those with mental illness. Only by addressing the criminal justice system as a whole will be build the lasting trust between \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and the communities that most need their services.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 So that's a small window into what we're doing in the policing and criminal justice areas. Ultimately, change requires commitment and work at the local level - through persistent and authentic engagement between law enforcement and the communities they serve. That is one of the reasons that we work so closely with U.S. Attorneys around the country and here in Denver. The U.S. Attorneys provide essential expertise and knowledge to the Division as we address similar issues in sometimes very different communities. John Walsh and his staff are crucial partners to the Civil Rights Division in this work.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 I would be remiss if I did not also tell you that John Walsh and his staff are crucial partners for the Civil Rights Division in civil rights matters beyond policing and criminal justice. John's staff has long collaborated with the division on a range of civil rights matters, most notably enforcement of the Americans with Disabilities Act. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Before I leave, let me be clear about something: We can accomplish the sweeping reform I have discussed. In Portland, Oregon, for example, two and a half years after we identified an institutional pattern of excessive force against people with mental illness, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are being retrained, accountability measures implemented and the incidence of using force has dropped dramatically. And right next door in East Haven, Connecticut, residents are seeing transformative change in their \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  department just two years after the entry of a consent decree with the Justice Department. There is reason to be optimistic and believe that we can achieve reform that will keep individuals, communities and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  safe and ensure that communities have fair, impartial and constitutional policing. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There is undoubtedly much work to be done but law enforcement and communities alike feel the urgency right now. The commitment of the Civil Rights Division, U.S. Attorneys and the Justice Department is part of this work, as is commitment by attorneys and local bar associations. Criminal justice reform at legislatures and city councils is part of this work. Strong law enforcement leadership throughout the country is part of this work. And the hard, authentic dialogue in communities all over the country with law enforcement is part of the work. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Beyond the federal government and the legal community, there are concrete roles for people committed to improving \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -community relations, enabling racial reconciliation and promoting justice. It may seem trite but it is powerful when local communities and law enforcement engage directly and constructively with each other, when local leaders have relationships with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  chiefs, when we can understand each others' perspectives, each others' lives. This is hard, inglorious work, but it's essential. And there's a role here for anyone who wants a safer, fairer, more equal society.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There is no problem too intractable or impossible for people committed to justice. Justice requires hope and hard, persistent work. We cannot sit idly by and hope that the public attention these issues are receiving will diminish, because they won't, or at least not for long. And so I thank you for your work and for your commitment to justice. Thank you.

\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 DATELINE: \b0 \i0 \ul0  RICHMOND, CALIF.  
\par \pard 
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  BODY:
\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Residents packed the City Council chambers here in 2005, hoisting signs emblazoned with photos of slain loved ones. Eight men had been shot dead in gang-related violence in a two-week span.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Many residents had long had contempt for the Richmond \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Department, with its decades-old reputation of racism and ruthlessness. The community rarely cooperated with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  making even minor crimes hard to solve.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 New to town, City Manager Bill Lindsay believed that change would come only with an overhaul of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  practices. He turned to an unlikely reformer: Chris Magnus, the white, gay \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  chief of Fargo, N.D.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A decade later, this minority-majority city has recorded its lowest homicide rate in 33 years. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -involved shootings are now rare: There have been two since Magnus came on board, whereas outside \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  agencies killed five men inside city limits during the same period. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Community mistrust has gradually given way to collaboration, thanks to deepening bonds between \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and the neighborhoods they serve.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Now, as angry residents riot over use of force in Baltimore -- and Ferguson, Mo., before that -- state and federal leaders are tapping Magnus, 54, to share his approach.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Magnus acknowledges that the gains have involved some luck. But he and outside experts attribute them largely to a hard-won culture change.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Residents have also stepped up.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We changed some of the ideas the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  had about us, and we changed some of the ideas we had about them," said Bennie Lois-Clark Singleton, 80, who participates in weekly street walks to coax at-risk youths to reject violence.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 --
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Positive interaction
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The video went viral. Two \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  working the annual Juneteenth festival were showing off their moves to the line-dance hit "the Wobble." Onlookers hooted encouragement.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The resident who captured the scene at the celebration of African American history later called it "awesome" to see how the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  "were interacting with the community." But it wasn't always so.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A shipbuilding hub during World War II, Richmond struggled when jobs vanished. The urban core is still depressed in this city of 107,571 -- more than 80% of whom are nonwhite -- and a dozen gangs remain active.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In 1982, minorities' relations with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  boiled over when tactics of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  known as "the Cowboys" came into wider light. Separate \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 fatal police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shootings of two black men in their beds led to a $3-million judgment, then the largest civil penalty in the country for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  abuse.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A judge noted "significant" evidence of an informal policy that "encouraged and authorized violence and brutality by Richmond \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  against black residents."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 As demographics shifted, problems persisted. In 2002, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  clearing a street on Cinco de Mayo roughed up and pepper-sprayed Andres Soto and his sons. In a holding cell, Soto found more than a dozen other Latino men swept up by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  The community protested. The group won a settlement.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "That was the crack in the mirror," said Soto, 59, an environmental activist.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Two interim chiefs followed. Then, in December 2005, Lindsay hired Magnus, who had climbed the ranks in Lansing, Mich., before heading the force in Fargo.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "He just completely opened up the department," Soto said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 --
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 New relationships
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 When Magnus arrived, he quickly realized he had to craft a command team committed to the vision of "more human relationships," he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There were challenges. Soon after he took the post, seven high-ranking African American \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  sued, accusing Magnus of making racist comments and bypassing them for promotion. The case dragged on for years. After a three-month civil trial in 2012, the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  lost on all 72 counts.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 All the while, the chief was pressing reforms.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He disbanded roving street teams that had focused on arrests, replacing them with neighborhood-based policing. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attend neighborhood meetings and give out their cellphone numbers. The department installed monitored street cameras and a gunfire detection system and employed sophisticated software to better predict and prevent crime.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 On a recent shift, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Chris Llamas edged his patrol car over the railroad tracks. Members of a Norteno gang had entered Sureno territory to leave their tag, which Surenos had crossed out and replaced with their own. It could easily escalate into shooting, the 13-year veteran concluded.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Code enforcement workers now fall under Magnus' command, leading to quicker action on graffiti, drug houses and other blight. The tags would "be gone by tomorrow," Llamas said after making a call. Soon, he and his partner were rousting public drinkers in a parking lot. A new merchants association had asked for help with the loitering, and received it.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Enlisting community members as partners has also yielded benefits.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Richard Boyd, an organizer with Contra Costa Interfaith Supporting Community Organization, recalled that when he moved to Richmond, shortly before Magnus did, young men loitered in his neighborhood, flashing guns and shooting dice.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "There was no genuine policing, there was no genuine street cleaning, road repair services," Boyd recalled. "They wouldn't respond to any quality-of-life issues."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 That soon changed. Though still troubled by violence, the Iron Triangle neighborhood has calmed noticeably, and families with children play in a radically revamped Nevin Park.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We were able ... to call [the beat \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ] directly and say, 'There are eight guys out front gambling,' " Boyd recalled. "And those \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  would respond because they could feel our pain."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Through Boyd's interfaith group, clergy lead the weekly street walks and participate in an anti-violence program known as Ceasefire, attending "call-ins" where \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are also present to persuade active members to give up gang life.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I wouldn't call it trust, but they just know each other," said Tamisha Walker, 32, a one-time offender who runs a reentry program for former inmates. "The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  know the guys on the street, they know their families, they know that they have kids, if they've been to school."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But work remains. "It is individual \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and not the department as a whole that is respected," said Walker, who encourages offenders through Ceasefire to give up violence. "We still have \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  who we need to be careful about."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Toody Maher concurs. In collaboration with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  her Pogo Park nonprofit transformed a blighted lot into a vibrant park that employs residents as monitors and won a national award.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Sometimes the events on the ground don't correspond with the vision," she said, "but thank God we have the vision."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 --
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Extra training
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  supervisors gathered for a routine meeting -- to pick apart every incident of force over a two-month period. Each tackle of a fleeing suspect, arm-twist and kick was up for scrutiny, though none had prompted complaints.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A woman outside an apartment where a kidnapping involving a gun was unfolding had refused three orders to move. When an \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  sought to arrest her, a physical struggle ensued. The incident, the group concurred, had stoked emotions and proved a poor use of resources.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It's a good big-picture training point," offered \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Steve Andretich, the use-of-force trainer.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Maybe [the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ] could have said to the other witness, 'Hey, this is why we want you to move. Can you ask her?' "
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Weapons training has also expanded. Shooting-range sessions are held monthly to enhance precision. Quarterly, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  run through role-playing scenarios to help with split-second decisions on when to shoot and when to instead use Tasers, pepper spray or verbal persuasion, said Lt. Louie Tirona, the firearms instructor.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 They are also taught to stop when a suspect complies, and Tirona said he has found that rounds fired have "decreased noticeably," contributing to a higher survival rate of suspects. In four of the seven nonfatal \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shootings under Magnus' watch, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  fired only one round.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Laurie Robinson, a professor of criminology at George Mason University who co-chaired the Presidential Task Force on 21st Century Policing -- convened in the wake of the Ferguson unrest -- called Richmond's monthly use-of-force reviews "highly unusual." She said role-playing training, although more common in larger departments, puts Richmond on the "leading edge of good practice."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Magnus was one of "the most impressive" of the more than 120 people invited to testify before the task force, Robinson said, because he has forged collaborations with "not just the residents but churches and schools and social services and businesses."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But, she said, it is the combination of reforms -- better training, community policing and new technologies -- that truly set Richmond apart and could prove a model for other departments large and small.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A national expert on recognizing implicit racial and gender bias conducted department-wide training in February.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Weeks earlier, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  filled a conference room for a meditation training geared to help them remain relaxed, alert and focused.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Sgt. Robert Gray, a 25-year veteran who proposed the training, said it would have been laughed at a decade ago.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The idea of old-school cops, he said, "was to get the bad guys, get them to comply, and if that takes physical coercion, so be it. That's not the way to be, especially when you serve the community. And that's what we are -- servants."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Last September, after the city had gone seven years without a fatality, a Richmond \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shot and killed Pedie Perez, 24, contending that Perez grabbed for his gun. Perez's family disputes that version and has sued. An investigation is ongoing. Body cameras have since arrived.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Magnus knew community relations were at risk. He informed the public that it could attend the coroner's inquest; posted updates on social media; and was present at Perez's funeral at the family's invitation.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Last winter, the chief joined community members demonstrating in the wake of the Ferguson unrest and held a "Black Lives Matter" sign.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Richmond \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police Officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Assn. bristled, accusing him of illegally participating in political activities while in uniform. Magnus countered that he was merely acknowledging that "all lives matter" and showing respect "for the very real concerns of our minority communities."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Boyd did a double-take when Magnus reached for the sign but said he was not surprised.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He had first met Magnus at a march to the scene of a slaying that, it turned out, had occurred in Magnus' neighborhood.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There was this "blond-haired white guy going on about how he had heard the shots from his house," Boyd said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Sometimes I think he doesn't know he's the chief. He thinks he's one of us."

\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 DATELINE: \b0 \i0 \ul0  RICHMOND, CALIF.  
\par \pard 
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  BODY:
\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Residents packed the City Council chambers here in 2005, hoisting signs emblazoned with photos of slain loved ones. Eight men had been shot dead in gang-related violence in a two-week span.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Many residents had long had contempt for the Richmond \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Department, with its decades-old reputation of racism and ruthlessness. The community rarely cooperated with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  making even minor crimes hard to solve.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 New to town, City Manager Bill Lindsay believed that change would come only with an overhaul of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  practices. He turned to an unlikely reformer: Chris Magnus, the white, gay \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  chief of Fargo, N.D.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A decade later, this minority-majority city has recorded its lowest homicide rate in 33 years. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -involved shootings are now rare: There have been two since Magnus came on board, whereas outside \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  agencies killed five men inside city limits during the same period. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Community mistrust has gradually given way to collaboration, thanks to deepening bonds between \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and the neighborhoods they serve.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Now, as angry residents riot over use of force in Baltimore -- and Ferguson, Mo., before that -- state and federal leaders are tapping Magnus, 54, to share his approach.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Magnus acknowledges that the gains have involved some luck. But he and outside experts attribute them largely to a hard-won culture change.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Residents have also stepped up.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We changed some of the ideas the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  had about us, and we changed some of the ideas we had about them," said Bennie Lois-Clark Singleton, 80, who participates in weekly street walks to coax at-risk youths to reject violence.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 --
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Positive interaction
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The video went viral. Two \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  working the annual Juneteenth festival were showing off their moves to the line-dance hit "the Wobble." Onlookers hooted encouragement.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The resident who captured the scene at the celebration of African American history later called it "awesome" to see how the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  "were interacting with the community." But it wasn't always so.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A shipbuilding hub during World War II, Richmond struggled when jobs vanished. The urban core is still depressed in this city of 107,571 -- more than 80% of whom are nonwhite -- and a dozen gangs remain active.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In 1982, minorities' relations with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  boiled over when tactics of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  known as "the Cowboys" came into wider light. Separate \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 fatal police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shootings of two black men in their beds led to a $3-million judgment, then the largest civil penalty in the country for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  abuse.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A judge noted "significant" evidence of an informal policy that "encouraged and authorized violence and brutality by Richmond \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  against black residents."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 As demographics shifted, problems persisted. In 2002, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  clearing a street on Cinco de Mayo roughed up and pepper-sprayed Andres Soto and his sons. In a holding cell, Soto found more than a dozen other Latino men swept up by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  The community protested. The group won a settlement.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "That was the crack in the mirror," said Soto, 59, an environmental activist.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Two interim chiefs followed. Then, in December 2005, Lindsay hired Magnus, who had climbed the ranks in Lansing, Mich., before heading the force in Fargo.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "He just completely opened up the department," Soto said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 --
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 New relationships
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 When Magnus arrived, he quickly realized he had to craft a command team committed to the vision of "more human relationships," he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There were challenges. Soon after he took the post, seven high-ranking African American \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  sued, accusing Magnus of making racist comments and bypassing them for promotion. The case dragged on for years. After a three-month civil trial in 2012, the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  lost on all 72 counts.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 All the while, the chief was pressing reforms.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He disbanded roving street teams that had focused on arrests, replacing them with neighborhood-based policing. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attend neighborhood meetings and give out their cellphone numbers. The department installed monitored street cameras and a gunfire detection system and employed sophisticated software to better predict and prevent crime.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 On a recent shift, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Chris Llamas edged his patrol car over the railroad tracks. Members of a Norteno gang had entered Sureno territory to leave their tag, which Surenos had crossed out and replaced with their own. It could easily escalate into shooting, the 13-year veteran concluded.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Code enforcement workers now fall under Magnus' command, leading to quicker action on graffiti, drug houses and other blight. The tags would "be gone by tomorrow," Llamas said after making a call. Soon, he and his partner were rousting public drinkers in a parking lot. A new merchants association had asked for help with the loitering, and received it.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Enlisting community members as partners has also yielded benefits.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Richard Boyd, an organizer with Contra Costa Interfaith Supporting Community Organization, recalled that when he moved to Richmond, shortly before Magnus did, young men loitered in his neighborhood, flashing guns and shooting dice.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "There was no genuine policing, there was no genuine street cleaning, road repair services," Boyd recalled. "They wouldn't respond to any quality-of-life issues."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 That soon changed. Though still troubled by violence, the Iron Triangle neighborhood has calmed noticeably, and families with children play in a radically revamped Nevin Park.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We were able ... to call [the beat \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ] directly and say, 'There are eight guys out front gambling,' " Boyd recalled. "And those \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  would respond because they could feel our pain."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Through Boyd's interfaith group, clergy lead the weekly street walks and participate in an anti-violence program known as Ceasefire, attending "call-ins" where \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are also present to persuade active members to give up gang life.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I wouldn't call it trust, but they just know each other," said Tamisha Walker, 32, a one-time offender who runs a reentry program for former inmates. "The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  know the guys on the street, they know their families, they know that they have kids, if they've been to school."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But work remains. "It is individual \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and not the department as a whole that is respected," said Walker, who encourages offenders through Ceasefire to give up violence. "We still have \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  who we need to be careful about."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Toody Maher concurs. In collaboration with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  her Pogo Park nonprofit transformed a blighted lot into a vibrant park that employs residents as monitors and won a national award.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Sometimes the events on the ground don't correspond with the vision," she said, "but thank God we have the vision."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 --
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Extra training
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  supervisors gathered for a routine meeting -- to pick apart every incident of force over a two-month period. Each tackle of a fleeing suspect, arm-twist and kick was up for scrutiny, though none had prompted complaints.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A woman outside an apartment where a kidnapping involving a gun was unfolding had refused three orders to move. When an \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  sought to arrest her, a physical struggle ensued. The incident, the group concurred, had stoked emotions and proved a poor use of resources.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It's a good big-picture training point," offered \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Steve Andretich, the use-of-force trainer.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Maybe [the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ] could have said to the other witness, 'Hey, this is why we want you to move. Can you ask her?' "
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Weapons training has also expanded. Shooting-range sessions are held monthly to enhance precision. Quarterly, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  run through role-playing scenarios to help with split-second decisions on when to shoot and when to instead use Tasers, pepper spray or verbal persuasion, said Lt. Louie Tirona, the firearms instructor.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 They are also taught to stop when a suspect complies, and Tirona said he has found that rounds fired have "decreased noticeably," contributing to a higher survival rate of suspects. In four of the seven nonfatal \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shootings under Magnus' watch, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  fired only one round.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Laurie Robinson, a professor of criminology at George Mason University who co-chaired the Presidential Task Force on 21st Century Policing -- convened in the wake of the Ferguson unrest -- called Richmond's monthly use-of-force reviews "highly unusual." She said role-playing training, although more common in larger departments, puts Richmond on the "leading edge of good practice."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Magnus was one of "the most impressive" of the more than 120 people invited to testify before the task force, Robinson said, because he has forged collaborations with "not just the residents but churches and schools and social services and businesses."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But, she said, it is the combination of reforms -- better training, community policing and new technologies -- that truly set Richmond apart and could prove a model for other departments large and small.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A national expert on recognizing implicit racial and gender bias conducted department-wide training in February.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Weeks earlier, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  filled a conference room for a meditation training geared to help them remain relaxed, alert and focused.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Sgt. Robert Gray, a 25-year veteran who proposed the training, said it would have been laughed at a decade ago.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The idea of old-school cops, he said, "was to get the bad guys, get them to comply, and if that takes physical coercion, so be it. That's not the way to be, especially when you serve the community. And that's what we are -- servants."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Last September, after the city had gone seven years without a fatality, a Richmond \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shot and killed Pedie Perez, 24, contending that Perez grabbed for his gun. Perez's family disputes that version and has sued. An investigation is ongoing. Body cameras have since arrived.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Magnus knew community relations were at risk. He informed the public that it could attend the coroner's inquest; posted updates on social media; and was present at Perez's funeral at the family's invitation.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Last winter, the chief joined community members demonstrating in the wake of the Ferguson unrest and held a "Black Lives Matter" sign.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Richmond \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police Officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Assn. bristled, accusing him of illegally participating in political activities while in uniform. Magnus countered that he was merely acknowledging that "all lives matter" and showing respect "for the very real concerns of our minority communities."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Boyd did a double-take when Magnus reached for the sign but said he was not surprised.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He had first met Magnus at a march to the scene of a slaying that, it turned out, had occurred in Magnus' neighborhood.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There was this "blond-haired white guy going on about how he had heard the shots from his house," Boyd said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Sometimes I think he doesn't know he's the chief. He thinks he's one of us."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 TAHLEQUAH - The Tahlequah \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Department identified a 15-year department veteran on Tuesday as the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  who fatally shot a 35-year-old man during an altercation that was captured on another \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  body camera Saturday morning.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Randy Tanner, the agency's range master, remains on administrative leave while the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation completes an inquiry into the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of Joshua P. Crittenden, Tahlequah \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Chief Nate King said at a news conference. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Around 11:50 a.m. Saturday, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  went to a home in the 500 block of South Mission Avenue in response to a call indicating that two men had at least one gun in a white pickup that had been reported stolen, King said. The caller reported that the men had been fighting, he added.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Benjamin Brown, who was at the scene and was arrested on multiple felony warrants, gave \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  a fictitious name of the person who had been in the pickup with him, King said. Brown's father lives at the home where the shooting occurred, he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Others who were in the home Saturday morning told \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  no one else was inside, but the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  looked through the house because they believed the other \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suspect\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  - Crittenden - was \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The footage provided to reporters was from \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Bronson McNiel's body camera. McNiel was riding in a patrol car with Tanner the day of the shooting.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Come here, partner," one \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  can be heard telling one of the men, believed to be Brown. "Let's get your hands up."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 All four \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  at the scene were equipped with body cameras, but Tanner - originally only there in an observer role - did not activate his, King said. He also said another camera's lens was obscured and that the fourth did not capture footage until after the shooting occurred.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 All Tahlequah \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have had body cameras since August 2014, King said, but whether they are required to be turned on depends on the situation.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "A call of this nature, with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Tanner as an observing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  a training \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by the time it escalated, his body was in fight or flight," he said. "I'm not sure if I myself would have remembered to turn that camera on at that time."
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  reported finding Crittenden when he went through an attic vent on the home's south end, and they can be heard telling dispatchers he was in the attic with a weapon. The other occupants of the home "did not follow directions to remain in place on the back porch, causing the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  further safety concerns," King said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 One of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  can be heard saying he was concerned that Crittenden would jump into the home from a hallway attic access, using a flashlight to show the area in question.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The shooting can be heard but not seen on the recording, which also did not capture the altercation between Tanner and Crittenden that led to shots being fired. Tanner reported drawing his Taser to subdue Crittenden "until he discovered Crittenden did in fact have a handgun," King said, and that prompted the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to draw his gun, instead.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 King said Crittenden pointed his gun at Tanner multiple times. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  can be heard yelling that Crittenden had jumped out of the attic shortly before the shooting.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "He jumped. I can't radio. I'm on the wrong channel to tell them," one \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  identified as Pam Bell, can be heard saying. "He's got a pistol. He's jumped. I believe he did! ... Shots! Shots!"
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 At 12:14 p.m., six shots are heard from the home's southeast corner. Eight seconds later, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are heard saying, "We have a suspect down." An ambulance arrived about eight minutes later.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Crittenden did not shoot at Tanner, but King said he had "no doubt" that he would have done so if given the opportunity, adding that Crittenden had been told "on multiple occasions" to drop his weapon.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 OSBI Special Agent Charlie Mackey said investigators found a handgun near Crittenden after he was shot. King said the camera footage shows that Crittenden's gun had its safety in the "off" position and that one of the bullets hit the middle knuckle of Crittenden's right hand - indicating, he said, that Crittenden was holding his gun in front of him at the time he was shot.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "(Tanner) stated he was in fear of his life and believed using deadly force was his only option," King said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Crittenden was transported to a Tulsa hospital, where he died, authorities said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Brown remains in Cherokee County custody, jail records show.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Tanner was the only \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  who fired, King said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I feel like they acted decisively in a very dangerous and in a rapidly escalating situation," King said of his \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  "They made several attempts to end this situation peaceably, ... and he refused to do so time and time again."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The OSBI will send a report on its findings to the Cherokee County District Attorney's Office, who will determine whether Tanner's use of deadly force was justified, Mackey said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 King said Crittenden's family, whom he knew personally, have seen the body camera video.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Family members of both men told the Tulsa World on Tuesday that they didn't wish to comment.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "This is a tragedy in Tahlequah, no matter how it plays out, no matter what happened," King said. "A man lost his life. The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  that were involved in this (and) I myself, we will never be the same the rest of our lives."

\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  BODY:
\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 EDMONTON * The suspect in a shooting that killed an Edmonton \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and wounded another had been the focus of a lengthy hate crimes investigation.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Chief Rod Knecht says \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  had evidence going back to February of last year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The online hatred and bullying of an Edmonton family had become extreme and the family members were increasingly worried about their personal safety, at which time the Edmonton \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Service became involved," Knecht said at a Tuesday news conference 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Knecht identified the suspect as Norman Walter Raddatz, 42, who was known to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  although he did not have an extensive criminal record.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  had gone to the man's home in west Edmonton on Monday night to arrest him on an outstanding warrant for a bylaw offence. There were also going to serve him with documents ordering him to appear in court for criminal harassment.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 That's when gunfire broke out.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Knecht said eight \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  approached the door of the home but did not expect violence. They knocked and announced themselves as \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and, when no one answered, they started to break in.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Bullets flew through the door and the first \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in line, 38-year-old Sgt. Jason Harley, was shot once in the lower back as he turned around, said Knecht. Body armour saved Harley's life.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Const. Daniel Woodall, 35, was also wearing a vest but was hit with bullets elsewhere on his body and suffered a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 fatal,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  "catastrophic wound."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Knecht said the other \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  took cover and were pinned down by gunfire for the next 10 minutes. They came "very, very close to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death."\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  found 53 bullets in the house and garage across the street, said Knecht, who added the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  didn't fire any rounds.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Investigators believe Raddatz used a large-bore rifle, a powerful gun that carries big bullets and is often used to hunt big game animals.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Soon after, a fire started in the house and burned it to the ground. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  found a body in the basement they believe is Raddatz. An autopsy was to be performed Tuesday.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Knecht said \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are not looking for other suspects.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Woodall was recruited to the Edmonton force from Great Britain and had served with the Greater Manchester \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  He had been an Edmonton \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  for eight years and was assigned to the hate crimes unit.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He leaves behind a wife, Claire, and two young children. Knecht said the children were sleeping last night and their mother was to break the news to them Tuesday morning.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 On Twitter, she thanked people for the support she has received.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Your generous outpouring of love for myself and my boys fills my heart. He is my hero, our boys' hero &; Edmonton's newest hero," she wrote.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Edmonton Mayor Don Iveson choked back tears and struggled to talk to reporters.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I reflect the sadness that I feel in the community," he said. "But I feel this most deeply as a father of young children and I'm incredibly sad for them and for Mrs. Woodall."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But Edmonton is still a safe city, he said. "By and large, good people live here ... we rely on our \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to protect us from the few and the worst among us."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Prime Minister Stephen Harper also sent condolences to Woodall's family, friends and colleagues.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It is a very difficult reminder that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  across our country put their lives on the line every day to serve and protect our communities and keep us safe," Harper said in a statement.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It is the second \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of an Edmonton-area \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  this year. RCMP Const. David Wynn, 42, died in January at a casino in St. Albert, north of the city, while trying to track down the driver of a stolen truck. Auxiliary Const. Derek Bond was seriously injured but survived.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The shooter, Shawn Maxwell Rehn, was out on bail facing 15 charges, including escaping lawful custody, possession of a prohibited firearm and failure to show up for a previous bail hearing on the charges. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  found him dead in a home he had broken into.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The last \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to be killed on the job within Edmonton city limits was Const. Ezio Faraone, who was gunned down in June 1990 while trying to arrest a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suspect\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  who was fleeing from an \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  robbery. !@COPYRIGHT=\'a9 2015 Times &; Transcript (Moncton)

\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 An armed policeman murdered a man during an operation after firing six shots into him from close range, a court has heard.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Anthony Long blasted eight shots into a VW Golf carrying a number of suspected armed robber, six of which hit Azelle Rodney, jurors were told. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Two of the bullets were fired into the top of the victim's head, causing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 fatal\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  injuries, the Old Bailey heard.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  had swarmed the car in a 'hard stop' after believing those inside were armed with guns and on their way to commit a robbery.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Old Bailey heard how Long was a Specialist Firearms \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  (SFO), known as 'E7', at the Metropolitan \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  'SO19' division when he shot and killed Mr Rodney on 30 April 2005, in Hale Lane, in Mill Hill, North London.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Prosecutor Max Hill, QC, said: "The prosecution say that it was not necessary for Mr Long to open fire upon the Golf and Azelle Rodney.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Therefore, we say, Mr Long was not acting lawfully when he opened fire.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "That being so, Mr Long's actions in deliberately killing Azelle Rodney when it was not necessary to do so, make Mr Long guilty of murder."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The court heard Mr Rodney was sat in the rear passenger seat, behind Wesley Lovell and Frank Graham, when armed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  swooped.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  suspected the Golf contained firearms and the men were on their way to commit an armed robbery, said the prosecutor.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  set up surveillance on the car and a specialist firearms team was deployed in unmarked cars to follow the vehicle.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The prosecutor said: "As the Golf drove along Hale Lane, the order was given by the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in charge of the firearms team to carry out what is known as a "hard stop", during which the Golf was to be forced to a halt and boxed in by the unmarked \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  vehicles.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The hard stop was carried out in Hale Lane, with the result that one of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  firearms vehicles drew alongside the driver's side of the Golf.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The front seat passenger in that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  firearms car was the defendant Mr Long, who opened fire and shot and killed Azelle Rodney.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Mr Long fired eight shots, from short range and in quick succession, all of which were aimed at Azelle Rodney, though two lodged in the metalwork of the car door or missed, therefore six of the eight reached him.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The majority of those shots caused \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 fatal\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  injuries to Azelle Rodney, culminating in the final two shots which were fired into the top of Azelle Rodney's head."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr Hill told jurors they would need to 'consider very carefully' the actions of Long and the events surrounding the moment he 'pulled the trigger and opened fire' on the alleged victim.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Long sat in the glass-enclosed dock of the Old Bailey's Court 10 wearing a grey suit, pale blue shirt and navy blue patterned tie.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr Rodney's family members, including mum Susan Alexander sat in the well of the court as the prosecution opened the case.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Long, whose bail address was given in court as the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Federation Headquarters (Room 26), Federation House, Highbury Drive, Leatherhead, Surrey denies murder.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The trial continues.

\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  BODY:
\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 EDMONTON * The suspect in a shooting that killed an Edmonton \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and wounded another had been the focus of a lengthy hate crimes investigation.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Chief Rod Knecht says \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  had evidence going back to February of last year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The online hatred and bullying of an Edmonton family had become extreme and the family members were increasingly worried about their personal safety, at which time the Edmonton \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Service became involved," Knecht said at a Tuesday news conference 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Knecht identified the suspect as Norman Walter Raddatz, 42, who was known to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  although he did not have an extensive criminal record.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  had gone to the man's home in west Edmonton on Monday night to arrest him on an outstanding warrant for a bylaw offence. There were also going to serve him with documents ordering him to appear in court for criminal harassment.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 That's when gunfire broke out.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Knecht said eight \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  approached the door of the home but did not expect violence. They knocked and announced themselves as \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and, when no one answered, they started to break in.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Bullets flew through the door and the first \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in line, 38-year-old Sgt. Jason Harley, was shot once in the lower back as he turned around, said Knecht. Body armour saved Harley's life.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Const. Daniel Woodall, 35, was also wearing a vest but was hit with bullets elsewhere on his body and suffered a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 fatal,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  "catastrophic wound."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Knecht said the other \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  took cover and were pinned down by gunfire for the next 10 minutes. They came "very, very close to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death."\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  found 53 bullets in the house and garage across the street, said Knecht, who added the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  didn't fire any rounds.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Investigators believe Raddatz used a large-bore rifle, a powerful gun that carries big bullets and is often used to hunt big game animals.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Soon after, a fire started in the house and burned it to the ground. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  found a body in the basement they believe is Raddatz. An autopsy was to be performed Tuesday.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Knecht said \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are not looking for other suspects.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Woodall was recruited to the Edmonton force from Great Britain and had served with the Greater Manchester \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  He had been an Edmonton \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  for eight years and was assigned to the hate crimes unit.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He leaves behind a wife, Claire, and two young children. Knecht said the children were sleeping last night and their mother was to break the news to them Tuesday morning.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 On Twitter, she thanked people for the support she has received.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Your generous outpouring of love for myself and my boys fills my heart. He is my hero, our boys' hero &; Edmonton's newest hero," she wrote.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Edmonton Mayor Don Iveson choked back tears and struggled to talk to reporters.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I reflect the sadness that I feel in the community," he said. "But I feel this most deeply as a father of young children and I'm incredibly sad for them and for Mrs. Woodall."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But Edmonton is still a safe city, he said. "By and large, good people live here ... we rely on our \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to protect us from the few and the worst among us."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Prime Minister Stephen Harper also sent condolences to Woodall's family, friends and colleagues.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It is a very difficult reminder that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  across our country put their lives on the line every day to serve and protect our communities and keep us safe," Harper said in a statement.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It is the second \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of an Edmonton-area \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  this year. RCMP Const. David Wynn, 42, died in January at a casino in St. Albert, north of the city, while trying to track down the driver of a stolen truck. Auxiliary Const. Derek Bond was seriously injured but survived.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The shooter, Shawn Maxwell Rehn, was out on bail facing 15 charges, including escaping lawful custody, possession of a prohibited firearm and failure to show up for a previous bail hearing on the charges. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  found him dead in a home he had broken into.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The last \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to be killed on the job within Edmonton city limits was Const. Ezio Faraone, who was gunned down in June 1990 while trying to arrest a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suspect\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  who was fleeing from an \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  robbery. !@COPYRIGHT=\'a9 2015 Telegraph-Journal (New Brunswick)

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Malacanang has condemned in the strongest terms the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 fatal\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shooting of Vice Mayor Florante Raspado of Jones in Isabela province on Friday. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Presidential Communications Secretary Herminio Coloma Jr. stressed that violence has no place in Philippine politics and Filipinos are set to elect their leaders in less than a year from now.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "Siyempre po ayaw po natin 'yung ano mang banta sa katahimikan at kaayusan ng ating mga komunidad (Of course, we do not like any kind of threats to peace and order in our community)," Coloma told government-run dzRB radio.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "Hindi po natin dapat bigyan ng puwang [ang karahasan] at hindi rin po katanggap-tanggap na dahilan 'yung pulitika dahil ang pulitika naman po natin ay dapat ding isagawa nang naaayon sa batas (We should give violence a space and politics is not an acceptable reason for violence because politics should be done according to what the law dictates)," he added.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Coloma said as far as the killing of Raspado is concerned, the Philippine National \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  should conduct a comprehensive investigation of the incident and bring the killers to justice.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  On Friday, Acting Isabela \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  director Senior Supt. Amorsolo dela Cruz, said in an interview over dzBB said the two suspected gunmen of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 fatal\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shooting of Raspado were arrested after pursuing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  caught up with their getaway vehicle \\x96 a red Mitsubishi Adventure - along the highway going to Quirino.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Dela Cruz said the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suspects\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  who were \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  with M16 rifles, jumped out of their van and then engaged the pursuing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in a brief gun fight.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Dela Cruz said the suspected gunmen are both retired soldiers.

\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A bipartisan group of Maryland lawmakers on Monday will begin its work to develop recommendations for improving \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  training and enhancing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -community relations.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The legislative panel was formed last month by House Speaker Michael E. Busch (D-Anne Arundel) and Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller Jr. (D-Calvert) and tasked with providing the General Assembly legislative proposals to improve public safety and policing practices.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The committee's effort comes six weeks after riots broke out in Baltimore after the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old black man who suffered a severe spinal cord injury while in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  custody. Gray died a week after sustaining the injury. Six Baltimore \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have been charged in connection with his \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 State Sen. Catherine E. Pugh (D-Baltimore), who walked throughout Baltimore trying to spread calm during the state of emergency imposed because of the unrest, will be the work group's co-chairperson. She said she looks forward to developing strong proposals that will change how \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are hired and how they interact with residents.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I'm hoping that during the process that we don't rush," Pugh said. "I want to continue until we are sure that there is a sound policy."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Pugh said that the committee, which will hold an organizational meeting Monday, will hear from community groups, law enforcement agencies and criminal justice advocates. It will review \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  training and hiring practices, the role of independent review boards investigating shootings and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 deaths\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  involving \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and Maryland's Law Enforcement \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Officers'\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Bill of Rights, which among other things gives \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  10 days to secure representation before cooperating with an investigation.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Pugh said she is particularly interested in reviewing diversity training for law enforcement \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and looking at how often \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have psychiatric evaluations.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 State Sen. Jamie B. Raskin (D-Montgomery), who will be part of the 20-member group, said it will build off the progress the General Assembly made this year enacting some criminal justice reforms.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "There is this bipartisan consensus that too many people are being swept up in the process for nonviolent and victimless offenses," Raskin said. That, he said, helped lead to the passage of several bills designed to help ex-offenders turn their lives around.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Among them was one giving former offenders the ability to expunge some of their criminal records or shield long-ago or minor convictions from public view. Gov. Larry Hogan (R) vetoed a different measure that would have allowed felons who are on parole and probation to vote.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The conversation about criminal justice reform is taking place at a moment of fallen crime rates, so we are able to take a deep breath and examine what is working and what's not," Raskin said. "Meanwhile, the advent of cellphone photography also changed the public conversation about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -community relationships. Several of these very high-profile incidents from across the country have spotlighted that there is still a lot of progress to be made."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This year, the legislature approved a bill that sets the stage for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to wear body cameras. A commission will be formed to review best practices for using the cameras and set statewide policy.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Pugh said that because that commission has taken on the issue of body cameras, the work group can look at other topics involving \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  interaction with communities.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Criminal justice advocates have criticized the General Assembly for watering down or killing legislation dealing with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  conduct, including a measure that would have required the state prosecutor to investigate all \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -involved \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 deaths.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Del. Brett R. Wilson, an assistant state's attorney who is part of the work group, said he has asked the panel to gather information about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -involved shootings and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 deaths\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  across the state. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We need the numbers so we are dealing with facts, not anecdotes," said Wilson (R-Washington). He wants to look into the circumstances of each \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -involved \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  the race of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 victim and whether the victim was armed.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "If we start from there, then we can look at the causes - was it a lapse of training, overzealousness or something else?" Wilson said.

\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  BODY:
\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 DUBLIN -- A BART \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  accidentally shot to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by a colleague during an apartment search last year was so concerned about his lack of training that he asked his wife to sue the transit district if anything happened to him, according to a federal lawsuit. Kellie Smith, widow of BART Detective Sgt. Thomas "Tommy" Smith Jr., alleges that BART \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  chiefs routinely sent the transit agency's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  into high-risk searches without the backup of a trained SWAT -- Special Weapons and Tactics -- team.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 BART's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  leader also denied "training requests by BART detectives and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  who were required to do the building ... searches" without the SWAT team, according to a law firm's news release. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Unfortunately, the lack of training ultimately led to Detective Sgt. Smith's tragic \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 " said attorney Eustace de Saint Phalle.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Not only did Tommy himself foresee and fear this outcome, but this catastrophe could have been easily prevented and his life would have been saved," Saint Phalle said in the news release.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In a letter sent Wednesday to BART directors and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  managers, Kelliee Smith, herself a 20-year BART \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  veteran, said she had tried to confidentially resolve her concerns after her husband's January 2014 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 She said she had heard only "denials, a refusal to take responsibility, and a refusal to make necessary changes for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  safety and public safety."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 BART attorney Dana Fox said Monday that the shooting occurred despite BART's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  having had training that "far exceeded the standards required by (the state Commisison on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police Officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Standards and Training), the governing agency on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  training in California."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "While BART has not received the lawsuit, the BART family continues to mourn the loss of Sgt. Smith," Fox said in an email.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Kellie Smith said that she believes \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  know that BART is trying to disband its SWAT team and put more "high-risk tactical assignments on patrol \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and detectives."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 She also said in her letter that her husband was so concerned about the department's refusal to provide training or send out the SWAT team that he asked her to sue BART and deputy chief Ben Fairow "if anything happens to me." The complaint, filed Friday, specifically alleges that BART's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  department, under Chief Kenton Rainey and Fairow:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Did not allow the use of trained SWAT \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  for "potentially high-risk building and probation searches."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Denied "training requests by BART detectives and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 " who had to do building and probation searches without the assistance of BART SWAT.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Sgt. Tommy Smith, a San Ramon resident who headed BART's detective division, was assigned to lead a team of eight \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to search the apartment of a robbery suspect on Jan. 14, 2014.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Smith entered one door inside the one-bedroom apartment and emerged from another in shadow, prompting a fellow \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to think he might be an \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed suspect\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and shoot him, according to the Alameda County District Attorney's Office report on the killing.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The suit asks for an injunction to prevent BART from forcing employees into tactical operations without having the necessary training and to force BART to set training and policies for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and public safety.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It also seeks compensation for Kellie Smith and her young daughter.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Several residents reported items were stolen from their parked and unlocked vehicles in the 300 block of N. Eighth Street and 400 block of Center Street, according to Goshen \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Because of the close proximity and time frame, these thefts are being investigated as one incident and believed to have been committed by the same person(s)," said Tina Kingsbury, administrative assistant with Goshen \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Department. "There is no indication that the victims in these thefts heard any noise during the time of the thefts."

\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  BODY:
\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 May 09--On March 1, 1937, state Highway Patrolman J. Lee Clarke was fatally injured when his motorcycle got caught in streetcar tracks in Reading, causing him to veer into an oncoming coal truck. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The precise cause of most \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officer deaths\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  may have changed since the first half of the last century -- for instance, you no longer hear about motor cops wiping out on trolley tracks -- but the manner of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the majority of line-of-duty fatalities has not.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The seed for this column was planted while I was covering the annual memorial service May 1 at the state \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  station on Kenhorst Boulevard in Reading.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In the 110-year-history of Reading-based Troop L, 12 members made the ultimate sacrifice, but not necessarily in the way you might expect.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Although three Troop L members were killed during confrontations with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed suspects,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  six died in motor vehicle accidents and two died in helicopter crashes.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 One other trooper died accidentally of carbon monoxide poisoning shortly after assisting firefighters extinguish a vehicle fire in which two occupants were trapped in the wreckage.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Seventy-eight years after Clarke's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 fatal\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  collision with the coal truck, it's still far more likely that an \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  will be killed by accident than slain by gunfire -- or other methods, for that matter, according to a recent report by the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 That may have been expected in 1937, when seat belts and other safety standards were not as advanced as today. But in 2015, it's unacceptable.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In March, 50 municipal and state \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  from Berks and Schuylkill counties attended training in Hamburg as part of a national initiative called Below 100.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The goal is to reduce annual line-of-duty \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 deaths of officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in all states to fewer than 100.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The last year in which fewer than 100 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  died on duty was 1944. Annual line-of-duty \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 deaths\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the U.S. peaked at 278 in 1974 but averaged more than 150 the past 10 years, according to NHTSA.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The data indicate that too many \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers' deaths\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are due to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  negligence or carelessness, including speed too fast for conditions, inattention and not wearing seat belts, the report authors said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Apparently some, but certainly not all, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  do not practice what they preach.

\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 More than three years after two Pasadena \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  fatally shot an unarmed black teenager, a state appeals court heard arguments this week from the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  union, which is trying to block release of an independent report on the killing.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Portions of that report released during the legal battle called the slaying "troubling" and said the shooting was preceded by tactical mistakes. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 For about two hours Wednesday, a three-judge panel from the 2nd District Court of Appeal questioned an attorney for the Pasadena \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police Officers'\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Assn. as well as lawyers representing those who want the report released, including the Los Angeles Times and the teen's mother.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Richard Shinee, an attorney for the union, told the justices that the two \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  involved gave voluntary statements to criminal homicide investigators. But, he said, the department used those statements in a subsequent personnel review.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The chief of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  relied on those statements to decide if they violated [administrative] policy," Shinee said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The independent consultant's report, which was conducted for the city, used the private personnel information, so the entire report should be withheld from the public, he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The report has been kept secret since it was completed last summer. The Pasadena \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  union representing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Jeffrey Newlen and Matthew Griffin, who shot and killed Kendrec McDade on March 24, 2012, sued to block the report's release. The union contended the assessment of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers'\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  actions was legally protected personnel information.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But during oral argument, the justices questioned the notion that any information collected and put into a personnel file is prohibited from disclosure.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Justice Jeffrey Johnson wondered whether the phone book would get protection if it was put into an \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  personnel file. He suggested that under the union's argument, no shooting investigation should be public.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Presiding Justice Frances Rothschild said it would be a stretch to withhold the entire report, noting that the privacy protection is for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  not an entire department.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The appellate case stemmed from a ruling in November when Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge James Chalfant decided that most of the independent consultant's report could be made public, with limited redactions. The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  union then filed a petition with the appellate court to stop the release.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Kelli Sager, representing The Times, told the justices that only records generated for the specific purpose of appraisal or discipline constitute personnel records and the report was neither. She warned that the department could simply "sweep up everything" into personnel files.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The case illustrates the growing divide between \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  unions and the public when it comes to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  accountability. Sager said that given the national climate, the public has more interest than ever in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers'\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  use of deadly force.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We are talking about a young man shot eight times," she told the justices about McDade.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 McDade was being pursued by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  on Sunset Avenue when Griffin, in a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  car, cut off his path with the vehicle and, seeing McDade's hand at his waistband, shot him, according to prosecutors.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Newlen, chasing on foot and believing his partner had come under fire, shot the teenager as well.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Pasadena \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police Officers'\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Assn. included significant portions of the report in legal papers filed with the appellate court.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The report by the Office of Independent Review consulting group found Griffin and Newlen made faulty tactical errors, including a lack of communication between the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  their decision to enter a narrow alleyway and put themselves in a vulnerable position, and closing their distance on a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suspect\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  they believed was \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  based on a false 911 report.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "They repeatedly made tactical decisions that were not congruent with principles of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  safety," the report concluded, according to excerpts contained in the union filing.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Such tactical mistakes by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  putting themselves in a position of danger led to "the eventual perceived need to use deadly force," the report said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The report called certain maneuvers by Griffin "troubling," and concluded the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  made a "potentially disastrous mistake" when he got out of the patrol car without putting it in park. Newlen separated himself from his partner to chase McDade, even though department policy suggests that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  stay together during foot pursuits, the report stated.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Both \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were cleared of wrongdoing in the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Department's internal review and by the L.A. County district attorney's office. Pasadena paid about $1 million to settle wrongful-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  suits brought by McDade's parents.

\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  BODY:
\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Two Baltimore \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  say a man attempted to rob a hack driver, and then led them on a chase to an auto garage in Northwest Baltimore and pointed a pistol at them -- prompting them to fire their service weapons.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The standoff in the 5200 block of Eleanora Ave. on the morning of June 7 left Keith Davis Jr. hospitalized in critical condition with a gunshot wound to the face, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  said. He has been charged with 17 crimes related to the incident, including first-degree assault, attempted armed robbery and multiple gun violations, according to court records. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Davis, 23, of the 11700 block of Stonegate Lane, Columbia, is also charged with discharging a firearm. A \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  description of the events filed in Baltimore District Court makes no mention of his firing the .22-caliber long pistol that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  said he brandished.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The records do, however, provide the most detailed account of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -involved shooting to date.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Catherine Filippou and Lane Eskins were in the 3900 block of W. Belvedere Ave. about 10 a.m. June 7 to help investigate a car crash when an unlicensed cab driver, or hack, pulled into the accident scene and told the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  that his passenger had a gun and was attempting to rob him, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Davis then jumped out of the car and ran, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  said. Eskins gave chase.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Davis ran into the auto garage, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  said. Eskins and Sgt. Alfredo Santiago said they observed Davis "with gun in hand attempting to gain cover" behind a refrigerator and steel cabinets.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Davis then "raised his weapon and pointed it in the direction" of Eskins and Santiago, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  said. They said the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ordered him to drop the weapon and raise his hands, "which he refused."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Eskins and Santiago then opened fire, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  said. Davis "continued to take a position of cover," \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  said, and more \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were called to the scene.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  arriving said they could see that Davis was still pointing his weapon toward the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  they said, and "additional shots were fired."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Davis "then yelled that he would put the gun down and come out if the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  would not kill him," \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  said. He surrendered and "laid on the ground with his hands spread."
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  found Davis with a gunshot wound to his face and called for a medic, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  said. Davis was taken to Sinai Hospital in critical but stable condition, they said.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  said they found the long pistol on the top of the refrigerator Davis had used for cover. No \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were injured in the standoff.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Charles Holden, the hack driver, told \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  that Davis got into the front passenger seat and asked to be taken to the Yale Heights Apartments, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 On the way, Holden told \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , Davis "pulled out a handgun," demanded money and then patted down Holden's front pockets, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  said. Then Holden pulled up to the crash scene.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Eskins, Filippou, Santiago and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Israel Lopez have been placed on administrative duties pending a review of the shooting by the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Department's force investigation team, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  said. None of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has been involved in a shooting before, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Davis has been charged with attempted armed robbery, attempted robbery, three counts each of first-degree assault and second-degree assault, four weapons charges, failure to obey \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  theft, and three counts of reckless endangerment.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Davis is now being held in jail. He did not have an attorney listed in court records. A trial has been scheduled for July 14.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Also on Monday, the Maryland Transit Administration named MTA \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police Officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Aaron Jackson, 28, a three-year veteran of the force, as the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  who shot an \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed suspect\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the leg in the 5500 block of Harford Road on Friday night after "a struggle."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The man was taken to Johns Hopkins Hospital for treatment. Baltimore \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are investigating the shooting. Details have not been provided, and the suspect has not been identified or charged.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Jackson has been assigned to administrative duties pending the investigation.

\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Six Anaheim \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were justified in shooting and killing a suspected armed robber who opened fire on them during a SWAT standoff, Orange County prosecutors have determined.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Investigators have cleared \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Nick Bennalack, Mark Brydges, Jeff Burke, Douglas Elms, Catalin Panov and Steven Salicos for the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of Steen Thomas Parker, who spent an hour holed up in a vehicle at an auto lot during the standoff Sept. 19, according to a letter to Anaheim \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Chief Raul Quezada outlining the results of the district attorney's investigation. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Witnesses reported that Parker, 43, was confronted by a security \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  at a Fry's electronics store after he and an accomplice tried to steal electronic equipment. Parker reportedly pulled a handgun from a shoulder holster hidden under a blazer and pointed it at the security \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as he fled the store, the D.A. report says.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Authorities tracked him to a lot at Manheim Auto Auction in the 1300 block of North Tustin. The department's helicopter, a SWAT team and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  dogs responded to the area, while Parker hid in a BMW parked in the lot. According to D.A. investigators, Parker ignored numerous commands broadcast from the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  helicopter and from a SWAT vehicle, along with direct orders from \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  told D.A. investigators that they used a wide variety of non-lethal measures to get Parker out of the BMW, including gas, pepper ball and bean-bag rounds, as well as a rubber baton fired from a launcher.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Eventually, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  heard a gunshot come from the BMW and suspected that Parker was trying to "bait" the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  into thinking he had committed suicide so that they would come near the BMW. Several minutes later, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  saw Parker moving in the back of the vehicle and once again ordered him to get out, according to the D.A. report.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Parker appeared to be ready to comply, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  told D.A. investigators, raising his hands to show \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  a handgun magazine with at least two cartridges and beginning to move his body. The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  believed that Parker was under the influence of a controlled substance, since his movements were "short and choppy," and he was continually clenching his teeth and jaw.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  told investigators that Parker suddenly dropped his hands, then raised them again quickly, at which point an \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  fired a beanbag round, striking Parker in the shoulder. Parker fell to his right, clutched his shoulder and screamed, then pointed a handgun at two \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and began firing in their direction, according to the D.A. report.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  returned gunfire, they told investigators, striking Parker numerous times. He was pronounced dead at the scene.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A toxicology examination following Parker's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  determined that he had methamphetamine in his system.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 D.A. investigators concluded that the half-dozen \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  who shot Parker acted in self-defense.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Despite numerous commands to surrender and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  use of non-lethal force, Parker continued to brandish a handgun," the investigators wrote in the D.A. report. "Finally, Parker actually opened fire at the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  from close proximity. It is very hard to imagine a more dangerous set of circumstances to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  than being in close proximity to an \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  robbery \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suspect\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  who is pointing his gun at the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and firing at them."

\par \pard 
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  BODY:
\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A Hartford \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  who was arrested after he was involved in a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 fatal\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  crash while on duty was acquitted of all charges Monday by a Superior Court jury.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The prosecution of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Taikwon Dudley was transferred to the New Britain Judicial District from Hartford to avoid any potential conflict of interest. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Hartford \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  charged Dudley, 35, with negligent homicide with a motor vehicle, reckless driving, traveling unreasonably fast and running a red light after an investigation into the July 13, 2012, crash at Woodland Street and Albany Avenue.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Anthony Mansfield, 50, was seriously injured in the crash and died seven days later.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dudley's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  car, a Ford Crown Victoria, crashed into Mansfield's Chevy Cavalier about 12:45 a.m. Dudley said he was rushing to help other \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in pursuit of an \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed suspect\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  when the crash occurred.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Hartford \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  found that Dudley was driving 57 mph on Woodland Street and ran a red light before crashing into the passenger side of Mansfield's car. Dudley told \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  he slowed at the intersection and looked both ways and that the Cavalier then appeared in front of him. He had turned on his lights and siren 100 to 130 feet before the intersection, investigators found.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dudley's lawyer, Kevin Smith of New Haven, said the jury began deliberating Friday afternoon and reached its verdict about 11 a.m. Monday.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "This was a terrible tragic case and Taikwon certainly feels that way himself," Smith said. "He is grateful to the jury for their service."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dudley is satisfied with the verdict, but "still remains terribly sorry for this tragic accident," Smith said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Smith praised the jury for focusing on the evidence.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It's not a crime every time someone dies," he said. "A lot of times, for a jury, when someone died, there is a lot of pressure on them to place that blame somewhere."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Hartford Deputy \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Chief Brian Foley said Dudley has been on an internal assignment as the case has progressed.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Now that the criminal case has been adjudicated, there will be a separate administrative investigation," Foley said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mansfield's estate has sued the city, the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  department and Dudley. The case is pending.

\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  BODY:
\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The suspect killed in a shooting with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Monday was armed with a sawed-off shotgun, the Alberta Serious Incident Response Team's executive director said Tuesday. Susan Hughson said the incident began when the suspect was pulled over at 118th Avenue and Abbottsfield Road by two Edmonton \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Service \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  who had received a tip about a possible impaired driver at about 9:30 p.m. Monday. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The 31-year-old driver and sole occupant of the vehicle became involved in an altercation with the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ," Hughson said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The suspect was shot and died at the scene. A \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was also shot and wounded during the incident, but not critically injured. The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  remained in hospital Tuesday and was expected to make a full recovery.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The suspect's name is not being released, though he was known to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  He was not the owner of the car, but Hughson said \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have no reason to believe it was stolen.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Hughson said an autopsy will be performed Wednesday.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The ASIRT investigators concluded their work at the scene Tuesday morning.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Speaking to reporters at a news conference at \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  headquarters about 12:30 a.m. Tuesday, Edmonton \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Chief Rod Knecht said "a confrontation" occurred during the traffic stop.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "There was an exchange of gunfire and an EPS member was shot," he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said the suspect was fatally shot and pronounced dead at the scene.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  an eight-year veteran of the Edmonton \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Service, was taken to hospital by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  with a wound to his lower body.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Knecht described the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as being "heavily sedated, but in good spirits" overnight, surrounded by family and other \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  at hospital.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The injured \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  name has not been released. He is described as being in his 40s.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Knecht said the other \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  involved in the incident has been a member of EPS for 10 years.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A Nissan Maxima sedan remained parked in one of the westbound lanes of 118th Avenue on Tuesday morning, its driver's side door open. A large section of road and most of a neighbouring park was cordoned off with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  tape as investigators worked.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  could be seen taking photos and measurements around the area. "One of the most dangerous things \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  do is stop cars," Knecht said during the early morning news conference. "The public probably doesn't appreciate that because they think, 'Well I'm just getting a ticket or whatever else.' But it's really an unknown for us when we stop a car. You don't know who is in the vehicle and what they have been doing or what they plan on doing."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Hughson said she knows which \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shot the suspect and how many shots were fired, but would not release that information at this time. She said ASIRT has investigated six or seven shootings across Alberta since Christmas. ASIRT investigates incidents involving the province's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  that have resulted in serious injury or \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to any person, as well as serious or sensitive allegations of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  misconduct.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 DUBLIN >> A BART \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  accidentally shot to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by a colleague during an apartment search last year was so concerned about his lack of training that he asked his wife to sue the transit district if anything happened to him, according to a federal lawsuit. Kelli Smith, widow of BART Detective Sergeant Thomas "Tommy" Smith Jr., alleges that BART \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  chiefs routinely sent the transit agency's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  into high-risk searches without the backup of a trained SWAT - Special Weapons and Tactics - team. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 BART's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  leader also denied "training requests by BART detectives and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  who were required to do the building ... searches" without the SWAT team, according to a law firm's news release.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Unfortunately, the lack of training ultimately led to Detective Sergeant Smith's tragic \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 " said attorney Eustace de Saint Phalle.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Not only did Tommy himself foresee and fear this outcome, but this catastrophe could have been easily prevented and his life would have been saved," Saint Phalle said in the news release.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In a letter sent Wednesday to BART directors and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  managers, Kellie Smith, herself a 20-year BART \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  veteran, said she had tried to confidentially resolve her concerns after her husband's January 2014 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 She said she had heard only "denials, a refusal to take responsibility, and a refusal to make necessary changes for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  safety and public safety." 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 BART's attorney, Dana Fox, said Monday that the shooting occurred despite BART's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  having had training that "far exceeded the standards required by (the state Commisison on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police Officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Standards and Training), the governing agency on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  training in California."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "While BART has not received the lawsuit, the BART family continues to mourn the loss of Sgt. Smith," Fox said in an email.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Kelli Smith said that she believes \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  know that BART is trying to disband its SWAT team and put more "high-risk tactical assignments on patrol \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and detectives." 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 She also said in her letter that her husband was so concerned about the department's refusal to provide training or send out the SWAT team that he asked her to sue BART and Deputy Chief Ben Fairow "if anything happens to me.". The complaint filed Friday specifically alleges that BART's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  department, under Chief Kenton Rainey and Fairow: 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 o Did not allow the use of trained SWAT \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  for "potentially high-risk building and probation searches" and
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 o Denied "training requests by BART detectives and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 " who had to do building and probation searches without the assistance of BART SWAT.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Tommy Smith, a San Ramon resident who headed BART's detective division, was assigned to lead a team of eight \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to search the apartment of a robbery suspect on Jan. 14, 2014.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Smith entered one door inside the one-bedroom apartment and emerged from another in shadow, prompting a fellow \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to think he might be an \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed suspect\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and shoot him, according to the Alameda County District Attorney's Office report on the killing.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The suit asks for an injunction to prevent BART from forcing employees into tactical operations without having the necessary training and to force BART to set training and policies for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and public safety.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It also seeks compensation for Kellie Smith and her young daughter.

\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 June 03--A Mesa County woman suspected of fatally shooting her ex-husband died Wednesday from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head, but not before leading Weld County authorities on an hour-long chase that ended in Brighton.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The chase began shortly after 10 a.m. when Greeley \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempted to contact Barbara Ann Blanton-Marez, 39, of Grand Junction, in the 300 block of 35th Avenue. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Weld County dispatchers received a message from the Mesa County Sheriff's Office through the Colorado Criminal Information Center that Blanton-Marez was thought to be in the Greeley area.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 On Tuesday, Blanton-Marez was named a person of interest in Monday's suspicious \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of 50-year-old Lawrence Marez in his home in the 2900 block of Globe Willow Avenue in Grand Junction. Blanton-Marez was listed as armed and dangerous and possibly driving a stolen red 2007 Ford pickup.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Blanton-Marez also was wanted on a warrant for walking away from community corrections May 29, according to the Mesa County Sheriff's Office.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 She was serving a three-year sentence for a felony menacing conviction.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 When Greeley \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  located Blanton-Marez and the red Ford pickup on 35th Avenue, they attempted to pull her over, but she refused to yield. Instead, Blanton-Marez led \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  north on 35th Avenue to O Street and then east on O to U.S. 85. Blanton-Marez then sped south on the U.S. 85 Bypass toward Brighton.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The high-speed chase attracted the participation of the Weld County Sheriff's Office and the Colorado State Patrol, as well as several smaller agencies south of Greeley along the U.S. 85 corridor. Blanton-Marez exceeded speeds of 100 mph and crossed over to the northbound lanes on numerous occasions, said Sgt. Joe Tymkowych, spokesman for Greeley \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police. Officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempted to stop Blanton-Marez with tire spikes several times without success.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The one-hour chase ultimately came to an end at 11:05 a.m. in Brighton when Blanton-Marez crashed into a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cruiser. It was unknown which agency was involved in the crash and if there were any injuries to the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as of Wednesday afternoon, Tymkowych said. The chase contributed to one other crash, which occurred near Evans on U.S. 85. There were no injuries reported in that crash.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The crash in Brighton immobilized Blanton-Marez's vehicle. She elected to stay inside the pickup as \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  from several agencies surrounded her and waited for SWAT to respond to the scene. Greeley \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  used the armored vehicle to approach the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suspect\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  vehicle. The woman was reported as \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and dangerous, and she was seen with a weapon in her hand during the pursuit.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 While she was surrounded, Blanton-Marez apparently raised a gun to her own head and pulled the trigger, said Greeley \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Chief Jerry Garner.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Authorities closed U.S. 85 about 10:30 a.m. at Weld County Road 2 because of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  activity. It remained closed much of the day. It was reopened just before 6 p.m., according to the Colorado Department of Transportation.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I am very proud of the professionalism and restraint shown by our \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  during this dangerous incident," he said in a news release. "The situation could have ended very badly, and I am so thankful that innocent persons were not harmed by a highly dangerous suspect."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Blanton-Marez married Lawrence Marez in March 2014, according to reports by the Grand Junction Daily Sentinel. Mesa County records showed the couple lived in the 2900 block of Globe Willow Avenue. They later divorced.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Blanton-Marez also was arrested Aug. 6, 2013, by the Grand Junction \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Department when her then-boyfriend reported being stabbed with a kitchen knife multiple times in the back and on his arms after the couple argued for most of the day at their apartment, according to the Sentinel.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A witness told the Sentinel a man was being stabbed as he tried to climb out a bedroom window.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 At the time, Blanton-Marez was five months pregnant with the man's child, according to court records.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The District Attorney's Office eventually charged her with second-degree assault causing serious injury, second-degree assault in the heat of passion, menacing and tampering with physical evidence.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A public defender who represented Blanton-Marez described her in court records as "probably having an IQ in the 70-80 range," while observing it was, "very difficult for her to understand basic criminal justice concepts," the Sentinel reported.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Mesa County Coroner was conducting an autopsy on Lawrence Marez's body Wednesday. A cause and manner of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  had not been released as of Wednesday afternoon.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Greeley \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Department will conduct an investigation of the vehicle pursuit, Tymkowych said. Colorado State Patrol is investigating the crash in Brighton that brought the chase to an end, and Brighton \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are investigating the shooting. The cause and manner of Blanton-Marez's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  will be released at a later date by the Adams County Coroner's Office.

\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 THE GOVERNMENT says it has decided to appeal against the judgment in the high court in Pretoria relating to Sudanese President Omar Al-Bashir. The Government Communication and Information System said yesterday the reasons for the appeal would appear in an affidavit that would be submitted within the prescribed due date. This follows the International Criminal Court's call for the government to fulfil its obligations to the Rome Statute by arresting the Sudanese president after the court issued international warrants against him for human rights violations in his country. Earlier this month, Bashir was in South Africa to attend the 25th AU summit in Sandton. He left the country in contradiction of a court order. - sanews.gov.za

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The report said Dimas was dispatched to an apartment complex in the area of San Bernardino Avenue and Sycamore Avenue in Colton for a fight involving five people.

\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The University of Oxford's parkland was sealed off by armed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  yesterday in their hunt for a man wanted in connection with the murders of a couple and their six-year-old daughter.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Jed Allen, 21, a former university groundsman, is the son of the dead woman, and the killings are being blamed on a domestic incident.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  released a photograph of Mr Allen, who has a tattoo of a tarantula covering most of the back of his left hand and a scorpion on the right. His chest has a tattoo of a bear. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  say people should not approach the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suspect\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , who is believed to be \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Janet Jordon, 48, her daughter Derin and Philip Howard, 44, were found dead in Vicarage Road, Didcot, 12 miles south of Oxford, on Saturday night. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Ms Jordon's Facebook page is full of photographs of her family, including one of Mr Allen holding his little sister.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Detective Superintendent Chris Ward, the head of the Thames Valley \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  major crime unit, said: "The likely cause of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is stab wounds. We are carrying out a number of searches. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Armed officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are assisting. The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suspect\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has a weapon."
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were called to the redbrick town house at 8.23pm. The victims, who had been living in it for only about two months, were pronounced dead after ambulance staff arrived.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Oxford University Parks, a 70-acre area of parkland beside the Cherwell, was closed yesterday. Armed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  with shields and dogs could be seen on the lawns. A \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  guarded the locked gates.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr Allen's social media pages indicate that he is a fan of fantasy comics and films. He has at times tried to adopt the look of Wolverine, a character from X-Men, complete with a quiff, bushy sideburns and blades coming out of his hands. His username on the Kik messaging service is WolverTooth. He wrote on Facebook last summer: "Work's turned sour already. Fed up of being treated like dirt. I quoted Batman."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He has uploaded a picture of himself at work holding an axe, and another of a knife he bought, using the hashtag #crocodiledundee. A gym enthusiast, he has used the nickname Mr Meat Tank. He recently uploaded the quotation: "Once you have accepted your flaws, no one can use them against you."
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were also searching for Mr Allen in Didcot.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr Ward said: "The first appeal is to look for a chap called Jed Allen - he is now a suspect. He is ... 6ft tall, he is of large build but, distinctively, he has a tattoo on his left hand of a spider.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It is very important we locate him as quickly as possible. I don't believe there is any danger to the wider community. If anyone sees him they should not approach him. Anyone with information about him I am genuinely appealing for them to contact us.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We have \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  actively looking for him at the moment. We know he has connections with Oxfordshire. We have carried out inquiries last night at addresses he might be. At this stage the families of the victims have been informed and they are being looked after by specialist, trained \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 "
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Floral tributes began piling up at the murder scene. A yellow teddy bear was placed inside the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cordon.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A handwritten tribute on a bunch of flowers said: "To my best friend, my soul mate, Jan, Dezzy and my anorexic Phil and my gorgeous Jed. You are my family and always will be. I will miss you all each day. You have all left a massive void in my heart which will never be filled."

\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  BODY:
\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ST. LOUIS o A third teenager has been charged in the hammer slaying of Bosnian immigrant Zemir Begic in the city's Bevo Mill neighborhood.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Juan Carlos Fabian-Lutz, 16, was certified as an adult and charged Tuesday with first-degree murder and armed criminal action. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He was ordered jailed in lieu of $1 million cash-only bail.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  say that about 1:15 a.m. on Nov. 30, Fabian-Lutz and three other teens exchanged words as Begic, his girlfriend and two other friends walked past them and got in Begic's car parked near Gravois Avenue and Itaska Street.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  said one of the teens jumped on the back of Begic's car and began hitting it.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Begic then got out and exchanged more words with the teens.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He was attacked and struck with what \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  said was more than one hammer.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Darrian Johner, 16, of the 3500 block of Minnesota Avenue, was charged in February in the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 fatal\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  beating. Robert Mitchell, 17, turned himself in to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  less than 24 hours after the incident and has been charged with first-degree murder and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  criminal action.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A fourth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suspect\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  identified in court records only as "T.K." has not been charged in Begic's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Begic was killed amid elevated racial tension in the St. Louis area about a week after a grand jury decided not to indict a white Ferguson \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  for fatally shooting a unarmed black teenager. Some claimed that Begic was attacked because he was Bosnian; the suspects are white, black and Hispanic, according to authorities. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  said the investigation has not revealed a racial motive.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Fabian-Lutz lives in the 4100 block of Eichelberger Street.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Begic's youngest brother, Rasim Begic, 20, of Waterloo, Iowa, said he and his family are hoping for justice.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It's not easy looking at the pictures of the boys who killed my brother," he said in an email.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "And I wish it never happened. We as a family miss him a lot. He will live within us forever."

\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Statistics show that America's racial issues aren't going away
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In a report citing the kind of troubling figures that, had they applied to most other countries, might have prompted warnings of necessary foreign intervention, the Washington Post notes at least 385 people \'e2[#x20ac]" ranging in age from 16 to 83 \'e2[#x20ac]" have died at the hands of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  across the United States this year. One in six of those \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 victims was unarmed\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , it said, and most were black or Hispanic. And less than 1 per cent of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  involved in the cases were charged with any criminal offence.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The United States is a populous country, so fatality rates in upholding the law are apt to be relatively high. Regardless, a growing number of Americans are alarmed at the statistics piling up this year. The Washington Post reported that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have been directly or indirectly involved in the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 deaths\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of a daily average of 2.6 people thus far in 2015. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The FBI, however, says the figure is actually 1.1 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 deaths\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  a day, based on statistics over the past decade showing 400 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 fatal police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shootings a year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 However the fatalities are tallied, the only "good news" is that American democracy prevents such numbers from being swept under the carpet.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 On the contrary, the rising body count is routinely reported, and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  killings of unarmed citizens have sparked demonstrations \'e2[#x20ac]" and riots \'e2[#x20ac]" in several towns and cities. Excessive use of force by the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  especially against minorities, has tarnished the American justice system.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 High-profile figures have gone on record as saying there is a major flaw and it needs to be addressed.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 At the same time there is growing suspicion that we have yet to understand the true magnitude of the problem.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 African Americans are attempting to address the issue by various means, including a global #124online campaign that carries #124the social-media hashtag "#BlackLivesMatter". The racist undertones of the killings are clear enough: two-thirds of the unarmed citizens who have died by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  hands were either African American or Hispanic, even though it should be noted that the overall count for both \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed and unarmed victims\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is virtually equally divided between Caucasians and minority groups.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 For the moment we are left with the troubling spectacle of American diplomats around the world promoting the right to vote, when in their own country citizens are being denied the presumption of innocence unless found guilty in court, a fundamental right of the US Constitution.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The world is prepared to admire "the American dream" and appreciates the many benefits and opportunities shared by the US, but we are also seeing a country that has never truly embraced the equality espoused by its founding fathers.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 True democracy protects the innocent, regardless of race or creed, and doesn't presume guilt. It ensures that everyone has the same chances in life.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The family and friends of the innocents killed by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  will care little now for American military or technological might.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The system has let them down in a way that could have been easily avoided had genuine democratic principles been securely in place.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The cracks in American democracy will hopefully grow no bigger, but attempts to paper them over \'e2[#x20ac]" for example by diverting public attention to imagined or perceived threats from overseas \'e2[#x20ac]" threaten the country's future in a far direr manner than any jihadists or military rivals.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dissent will only fester and an explosion will be inevitable. Beyond America's borders, its innate hypocrisy is already the subject of disdain and ridicule. These internal and external forces must not be allowed to combine and undermine all the good that the US claims to stand for and stand up for.

\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  BODY:
\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 May 19--A former \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  chief who teaches at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York thinks a Fayetteville \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  acted appropriately when he shot and killed Nijza Lamar Hagans in January 2013.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Separately, lawyers for the city of Fayetteville on Monday ended their effort in federal court to keep secret from the public a video of the shooting following its publication last week by The Intercept online news website and other media outlets, including the Observer. The person who leaked the video has not been identified.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Hagans' father Reggie Hagans has filed a wrongful \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  lawsuit against the city over Nijza's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Aaron Lee Hunt, who is American Indian, shot and killed 22-year-old Nijza Hagans, who is black, during a traffic stop in a residential driveway off South Virginia Avenue of Morganton Road. Hagans had a gun poking out of his pocket, Hunt said afterward, and appeared to reach for it before pushing the car's door into Hunt and jumping out.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Hunt fired three times at Hagans' front as Hagans came out of the Ford SUV and rushed past him, the video shows. He fired two more times at Hagans' back as Hagans tried to run away. Autopsy evidence appears to show he was hit twice from the front and twice in the back.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Once a person is armed ... then he is immediately a threat, and poses a deadly threat to life and limb of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 " said Associate Professor John DeCarlo of the Department of Law, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Science and Criminal Justice Administration at John Jay. DeCarlo watched the video of the shooting.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 When Hagans pushed the car door into Hunt and moved out of the car toward Hunt, DeCarlo said, Hunt couldn't know if Hagans intended to shoot him, fight him or run away, "but we know that he has a gun and the outcome couldn't possibly be good. So the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is not required to get shot at in order to take action."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Under North Carolina law and federal court rulings, the shots to Hagans back are permissible, DeCarlo said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It's a shame that anyone has to lose their life over a traffic stop," he said. "However, the totality of the circumstances clearly say that he remains an \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed suspect,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  still able to turn around and shoot you, even though he's running away."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 DeCarlo is a former chief of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Branford, Conn.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The lawsuit contends the traffic stop was illegal, conducted as a pretext to search Hagans' vehicle as part of a pattern of racially motivated traffic stops by Fayetteville \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "At no time during his encounter with Defendant Hunt did Nijza Lamar Hagans point, hold, brandish, reach for, display, or otherwise use or threaten to use a weapon of any kind," the suit says.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The city was trying to keep the video of the shooting from being made public. State law allows \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  departments to keep from the public videos such as this one, made by camera on the dashboard of Hunt's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cruiser. It says in court papers that in lawsuits such as this, normally it obtains a court order telling plaintiffs' lawyers, such as Billy Richardson and Chuk Umerah in Hagans' case, they must not share the video with anyone. But the city failed to do that this time.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 After the city's lawyers realized this, they requested that the video and other items be returned by Richardson and Umerah. The city followed up with by filing a motion to ask a judge to make Richardson and Umerah give up the materials. In court papers, the city's lawyers contend that Richardson and Umerah were obliged to keep the video and four other items of evidence secret until the judge made a decision on the matter.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The paperwork also says that Richardson proposed an out-of-court settlement in which the video would be kept secret.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Richardson, in papers filed last week, counters that the video and other materials weren't required to be kept secret and the city's lawyers waived their option to keep the video privileged from public dissemination.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 With the publication of the video last week, the city's lawyers conceded that their request is now moot.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Jimmie Buxton, head of the Fayetteville branch of the NAACP, viewed the video last week.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The organization has been outspoken in cases in which it thinks \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were wrong in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shootings. But in this case, Buxton said, the organization is withholding comment while the lawsuit is pending.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I just suggest that anybody that's interested, needs to see the full tape and hear the sound" of when the shots were fired, Buxton said.

\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  killed a drug trader wanted on multiple charges on Sunday in Muang district after he resisted arrest by trying to attack \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  with a hand grenade.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Pol Sub Lt Sathit Samosorn, a duty \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  at Muang Surat Thani \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  station, and a colleague were patrolling when they came across a man and a teenage woman having a heated argument in front of Rin Thong housing estate.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 When the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  approached the pair, the man, identified later as Sanit Chantana, 39, who appeared to be under the influence of drugs, held out a grenade to threaten them, then hijacked a passing pickup truck and sped off. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Pol Sub Lt Sathit radioed other \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to intercept the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed suspect\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Sanit abandoned the truck in an alley in Makham Tia sub-district after he was shot in the back by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  who were pursuing him and went into hiding in a pond in a forested area.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 About 50 policemen surrounded the pond and urged him to surrender. Sanit agreed to come out of the pond after more than an hour. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ordered him to keep his hands in the air and turn around. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The suspect initially kept his hands on his head but then grabbed the grenade from under the water and tried to pull the safety pin when \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  approached. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Other \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  immediately opened fire.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Pol Col Wisut Poopansri, chief of Muang Surat Thani \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  station, described the explosive device as an anti-personnel grenade with a destructive radius of 15 metres. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Surat Thani \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  chief Pol Maj Gen Apichart Boonsriroj said Sanit was wanted on several drugs warrants issued in the province. He had previously fought with an anti-drug \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  unit who tried to catch him when he was using firearms and grenades. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The suspect was a henchman of Jaknarin Chankomol, 29, leader of a major drug gang in Surat Thani who was killed by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in June last year, Pol Maj Gen Apichart said.

\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  City of Spokane, The State of Washington issued the following news release:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The critical incident protocol has been invoked and the Spokane Investigative Regional Response (SIRR) Team is investigating an in-custody \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  that occurred this morning. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  from the Spokane \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Department arrested the suspect this morning after being called to the 5400 block of N. Addison for a domestic violence call where the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suspect\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was allegedly \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  with a rifle. The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suspect\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was transported to jail and later suffered a medical emergency. He immediately received life-saving medical attention, but later died at a local hospital.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Today, 05/13/2015, just before 6:00am, patrol \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  from SPD responded to the 5400 block of N. Addison on the report of domestic violence. Information from the complainant was that a female and male were arguing and the male had possibly hidden a gun on the side of the residence. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were able to determine there was a domestic violence no-contact order in place and the suspect was in violation of that order. The order made it illegal for him to possess firearms. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  took the suspect into custody without incident and located a firearm at the residence. They also noted that the suspect appeared to be "high". He was talking with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prior to the transport and admitted to "drinking something".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The suspect was transported to Spokane County Jail to be booked for Unlawful Possession of Firearm and Felony Violation of a Domestic Violence No Contact Order, which under Washington law is a mandatory booking. While in route to jail, he began kicking on the back of the patrol car. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  notified jail staff to prepare for an uncooperative male. Jail staff met the patrol car in the sally port, where the suspect was uncooperative. Jail staff escorted the suspect, still handcuffed, into the booking area. Because he continued to be uncooperative, jail staff prepared to place him in a restraint chair to keep him from hurting himself or others. During that process, he had a medical emergency.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Resuscitation efforts were started immediately by correction \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Jail medical staff and Spokane City Fire medics were called to assist. At the time he was transported to the hospital, the suspect did have a pulse. Later, at the hospital, he was declared deceased.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This is preliminary information based on initial reports of the incident.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This is an ongoing investigation.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This continues to be an active and ongoing investigation. SIRR Team detectives will continue to process evidence, including video from the jail, interview witnesses and interview all the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  involved with this incident.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The SIRR Team is comprised of multiple agencies in Eastern Washington, including the Spokane County Sheriff's Office, Washington State Patrol, Spokane \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Department, and Airway Heights \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Department.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Spokane County Medical Examiner will release the name of the deceased individual as well as the official cause of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Washington State Patrol is the managing agency in this incident. All future communications on this incident will be sent via the SIRR Team. Once the SIRR Team investigation is complete, the case will be forwarded to the Spokane County Prosecutor's Office for review.

\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  City of Spokane, The State of Washington issued the following news release:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The critical incident protocol has been invoked and the Spokane Investigative Regional Response (SIRR) Team is investigating an in-custody \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  that occurred this morning. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  from the Spokane \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Department arrested the suspect this morning after being called to the 5400 block of N. Addison for a domestic violence call where the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suspect\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was allegedly \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  with a rifle. The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suspect\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was transported to jail and later suffered a medical emergency. He immediately received life-saving medical attention, but later died at a local hospital.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Today, 05/13/2015, just before 6:00am, patrol \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  from SPD responded to the 5400 block of N. Addison on the report of domestic violence. Information from the complainant was that a female and male were arguing and the male had possibly hidden a gun on the side of the residence. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were able to determine there was a domestic violence no-contact order in place and the suspect was in violation of that order. The order made it illegal for him to possess firearms. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  took the suspect into custody without incident and located a firearm at the residence. They also noted that the suspect appeared to be "high". He was talking with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prior to the transport and admitted to "drinking something".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The suspect was transported to Spokane County Jail to be booked for Unlawful Possession of Firearm and Felony Violation of a Domestic Violence No Contact Order, which under Washington law is a mandatory booking. While in route to jail, he began kicking on the back of the patrol car. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  notified jail staff to prepare for an uncooperative male. Jail staff met the patrol car in the sally port, where the suspect was uncooperative. Jail staff escorted the suspect, still handcuffed, into the booking area. Because he continued to be uncooperative, jail staff prepared to place him in a restraint chair to keep him from hurting himself or others. During that process, he had a medical emergency.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Resuscitation efforts were started immediately by correction \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Jail medical staff and Spokane City Fire medics were called to assist. At the time he was transported to the hospital, the suspect did have a pulse. Later, at the hospital, he was declared deceased.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This is preliminary information based on initial reports of the incident.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This is an ongoing investigation.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This continues to be an active and ongoing investigation. SIRR Team detectives will continue to process evidence, including video from the jail, interview witnesses and interview all the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  involved with this incident.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The SIRR Team is comprised of multiple agencies in Eastern Washington, including the Spokane County Sheriff's Office, Washington State Patrol, Spokane \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Department, and Airway Heights \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Department.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Spokane County Medical Examiner will release the name of the deceased individual as well as the official cause of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Washington State Patrol is the managing agency in this incident. All future communications on this incident will be sent via the SIRR Team. Once the SIRR Team investigation is complete, the case will be forwarded to the Spokane County Prosecutor's Office for review.

\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  BODY:
\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  City of Spokane, The State of Washington issued the following news release:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The critical incident protocol has been invoked and the Spokane Investigative Regional Response (SIRR) Team is investigating an in-custody \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  that occurred this morning. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  from the Spokane \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Department arrested the suspect this morning after being called to the 5400 block of N. Addison for a domestic violence call where the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suspect\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was allegedly \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  with a rifle. The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suspect\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was transported to jail and later suffered a medical emergency. He immediately received life-saving medical attention, but later died at a local hospital.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Today, 05/13/2015, just before 6:00am, patrol \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  from SPD responded to the 5400 block of N. Addison on the report of domestic violence. Information from the complainant was that a female and male were arguing and the male had possibly hidden a gun on the side of the residence. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were able to determine there was a domestic violence no-contact order in place and the suspect was in violation of that order. The order made it illegal for him to possess firearms. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  took the suspect into custody without incident and located a firearm at the residence. They also noted that the suspect appeared to be "high". He was talking with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prior to the transport and admitted to "drinking something".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The suspect was transported to Spokane County Jail to be booked for Unlawful Possession of Firearm and Felony Violation of a Domestic Violence No Contact Order, which under Washington law is a mandatory booking. While in route to jail, he began kicking on the back of the patrol car. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  notified jail staff to prepare for an uncooperative male. Jail staff met the patrol car in the sally port, where the suspect was uncooperative. Jail staff escorted the suspect, still handcuffed, into the booking area. Because he continued to be uncooperative, jail staff prepared to place him in a restraint chair to keep him from hurting himself or others. During that process, he had a medical emergency.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Resuscitation efforts were started immediately by correction \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Jail medical staff and Spokane City Fire medics were called to assist. At the time he was transported to the hospital, the suspect did have a pulse. Later, at the hospital, he was declared deceased.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This is preliminary information based on initial reports of the incident.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This is an ongoing investigation.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This continues to be an active and ongoing investigation. SIRR Team detectives will continue to process evidence, including video from the jail, interview witnesses and interview all the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  involved with this incident.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The SIRR Team is comprised of multiple agencies in Eastern Washington, including the Spokane County Sheriff's Office, Washington State Patrol, Spokane \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Department, and Airway Heights \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Department.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Spokane County Medical Examiner will release the name of the deceased individual as well as the official cause of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Washington State Patrol is the managing agency in this incident. All future communications on this incident will be sent via the SIRR Team. Once the SIRR Team investigation is complete, the case will be forwarded to the Spokane County Prosecutor's Office for review.

\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  BODY:
\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The city of Minneapolis has reached a nearly $63,000 settlement with a group of former \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  captains who sued Chief Jane\'e9 Harteau, claiming she pushed for their retirement and later reassigned them to inferior positions. After Harteau became chief in 2012, she made clear her intent to enforce the previously negotiated elimination of the captain rank and spoke publicly about her desire for older employees to retire. The captain positions were replaced with five "commander" slots that gave her the ability to appoint whomever she wanted, according to the lawsuit filed in Hennepin County District Court last fall. None of the former captains was selected as a commander, and all were slated for demotion to lieutenant if they did not retire.

\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  say four suspects kidnapped and threatened a disabled veteran during an \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  carjacking that ended with one \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suspect\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  being shot by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Thursday in north Minneapolis. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were called to 21st and Bryant Avenues N. around 4 a.m. on reports of a kidnapping, said spokesman John Elder. Earlier, a resident was reportedly carjacked near 12th and Knox Avenues N. and forced into his vehicle.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  spotted the victim's car, and during a foot chase, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  fired and struck one of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suspects\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , who was believed to be \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  authorities said. Two \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suspects\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were arrested, including the one who was shot, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  said. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are searching for the other two assailants.

Abbey Kae Russell, 24, died from freshwater drowning, and no foul play is suspected, according to the Ramsey County medical examiner's office. Test results showed Russell had a blood alcohol content of 0.336 percent, more than four times the legal limit for driving in Minnesota.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A Twin Cities health care products entrepreneur and longtime tax protester has been sentenced to five years in prison for running up a bill of more than $600,000 in back taxes, interest and penalties. The sentencing of Michael A. Schlegel, 56, of Corcoran, in federal court in Minneapolis last week follows his conviction by a jury on three counts of tax evasion, three counts of failing to file tax returns and conspiracy to defraud the federal government. No restitution was ordered by Judge Patrick Schiltz as part of the sentence, but Schlegel remains liable to the IRS.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A former Minneapolis \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  who lured adolescent girls into sexual encounters via social media was resentenced Thursday in Anoka County District Court after the Minnesota Court of Appeals overturned a previous lighter-than-recommended sentence. Bradley Schnickel, 34, was sentenced to 102 months in prison, taking into account good behavior and time served, meaning he has 32 more months to serve for five felonies that he pleaded guilty to in May 2014. Originally, he was to have been released in June.

\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A MAN was shot and killed in the Mamelodi West Hostels - allegedly by a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  - on Saturday evening.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Class Modibe was killed as he was walking along a passage in the hostel while \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were apparently conducting a crime prevention operation. 
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Lungelo Dlamini refuted the claim, saying the incident occurred when an \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  man tried to free detained \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suspects\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  during the operation.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "When \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  confronted him a shoot-out ensued and a bystander was fatally shot," Dlamini said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 However, this is in contrast to what hostel dwellers said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 They accused the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of lying and claim the shooting was a result of an extortion gone wrong.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Zizi Selala said Modibe was shot after a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  failed to solicit a bribe from him.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Selala, who regularly plays dice at the hostel, said they were harassed daily by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "When the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  came on Saturday I ran away because they had just taken money from me the previous day," said Selala.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Then they started shooting at me and that's when they shot Class because I was running in his direction.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  started shooting randomly at some point because I was already out of his vision," he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Selala said it had become a nightmare living at the hostel because of the constant harassment they experienced.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  always come here and demand money for one thing or another.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "If you don't give them they arrest you on a bogus charge. I was tired of it and decided I was going to run away this time," Selala said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Chairman of the hostel residents' association Daniel Sello said it was regrettable that a life had been lost at the hands of law enforcers.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It's always a struggle.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Those guys just play their dice and do not bother anyone but the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are always harassing them," he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dlamini said \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were investigating a case of murder but no arrests had been made.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The Independent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Investigative Directorate (Ipid) has opened a case on the shooting.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Ipid spokesman Moses Dlamini was not available for comment yesterday.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 l In his State of the City Address, mayor Kgosientso Ramokgopa said the city was exploring turning the hostels into bachelor units, rather than family units as had originally been planned because this would be more affordable to those living there who were unemployed or working in the informal sector.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Armed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shut down 70 acres of picturesque parkland as they searched for knife-obsessed Jed Allen, 21.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The former college groundsman has an intimate knowledge of the parkland, used by cricket and rugby teams as well as rowing squads. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Detectives named him as a suspect after the mutilated bodies of the girl and the couple were found at a house on Saturday night.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The victims were named as Philip Howard, 44, Jan Jordon, 48, and her daughter Derin.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  said Allen is related to them but it later became clear he is Ms Jordon's son.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Anyone who spots Allen is urged not to approach him but to dial 999 immediately.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The stocky six-footer, who often wears a baseball cap, has several tattoos including one of a large, black spider on his left hand.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Detective Superintendent Chris Ward, from Thames Valley \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Major Crime Unit, said: "It is very important that we locate him as quickly as we can."
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  closed the 70-acre University Parks, south of the city centre on the banks of the Thames, or Isis as it is called in Oxford.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Traumatic Marksmen along with a squad of 20 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  with dogs and riot shields moved through the parks yesterday afternoon. Part of the search centred on a pavilion.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  appeared to be focusing on the north-east of the parks close to where the River Cherwell flows into the Thames. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  warned passing tourists that the parks would be shut all day.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "There are a large number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  who have been deployed to find the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suspect\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ," said Mr Ward.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Armed police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were drafted in for the safety of the searching \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and there was no suggestion Allen had a gun, he added.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The alert for Allen was issued after \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  found the bodies of the victims in a house in a quiet street in Didcot, 13 miles south of Oxford, at about 8.20pm on Saturday.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  went to the property after a call from a neighbour, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Post mortem examinations are due to be carried out today but Mr Ward said: "The likely cause of each of their \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 deaths\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is stab wounds."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Allen appears to have a fascination with knives. He posted several photographs of himself on social media wielding various vicious-looking knives and an axe.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He also posed as the comic superhero Wolverine holding three clawlike blades between the fingers of each hand.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Allen, who has bushy side burns, seems to have modelled himself on the Wolverine character played by Hugh Jackman in the X-Men series of films.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It is understood the couple and Derin moved to the house in Didcot a few months ago.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Before that, they lived for many years in a house just over a mile away, where Allen was regularly seen, according to neighbours. Sheila Welch, a neighbour in Didcot, said yesterday that the couple and child always looked "happy". Ms Welch said: "They are new neighbours and had only been here a couple of months.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I used to see them - a lovely mother and a little girl. They always looked so happy."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Describing the scene when \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  turned up on Saturday night, Ms Welch said: "It was about half past eight and there were just sirens and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cars. All I can say is that I am very upset, it is all very traumatic."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A neighbour at the couple's former home said: "The little girl was always on her bike with her mum. "She was really nice, she used to smile and say hello when she saw you in the street."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Another ex-neighbour told how they moved away suddenly. She said: "One day they were gone. We didn't see any removal van until the new neighbours moved in."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Several addresses linked to Allen were visited by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  yesterday.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Forensic experts examined the murder scene. The bodies of the three victims were not moved until about 4.30pm.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Toys and flowers were left at the scene. Ms Jordan and Mr Howard had children by previous relationships who were being looked after by specialist, trained \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr Ward said: "We offer our condolences to the family. This is obviously a tragic and sad event." Allen attended the Marlborough School in Woodstock, north of Oxford. He lives in Didcot, according to his Facebook page.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The slow speed chase continued for about two hours, primarily on surface streets, Jenal said.  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  saw him waving a weapon. 
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  used a spike strip to flatten the minivans wheels, but the suspect continued driving on the van s rims.

The suspect, who was not struck by the gunfire, returned to the minivan and continued driving.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The minivan again came to a stop, apparently disabled, at Valley Boulevard and Mountain View Road.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  He put a blanket over him as he exited the van, to the point where you could not see his hands,  Jenal said.  Shortly thereafter, the blanket fell to the ground.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Jenal said the suspect suffered multiple gunshot wounds and was in  very critical condition  at an intensive care unit. His identity was not available. He was initially described as about 30 years old.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Graphic video of the incident that emerged online showed the suspect brandishing a handgun in the moments before he was shot. The view of the suspect is obscured at the moment \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  open fire.

\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ARMED \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were last night hunting a Wolverine fan with a spider tattoo suspected of butchering three members of his family.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Detectives warned the public not to approach Jed Allen, 21, who sports bushy sideburns just like the X-Men character and is believed to be \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The 6ft-tall \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suspect\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  vanished after his mum Janet, 48, his stepdad Philip Howard, 44, and his half-sister Derin, six, were found stabbed to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  at their home in Didcot, Oxon, at 8.23pm on Saturday. 
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  yesterday sealed off 70 acres of Oxford University parks as they searched for the former groundsman, who has a distinctive spider tattoo on his left hand.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 On his Instagram page Allen has numerous pictures of his Marvel Comics hero, including one showing a Wolverine 21st birthday cake.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In another snap he poses with knives between his fingers to look just like the character's razor-sharp claws.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He shows off a 10in hunting knife in a further pic. It is captioned: "Today's purchases.'' Another photo of the same weapon bears the message: "You call that a knife?" - a reference to a joke from 1986 comedy movie Crocodile Dundee.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Allen, who also posed with an axe, appears to have a scorpion tattoo on his right hand and a bear etched on his chest. Det Supt Chris Ward, leading the investigation, said \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were involved in "a number of searches" for Allen. He added: "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Armed officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are assisting with that search. The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suspect\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has a weapon.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It is very important we locate him as quickly as possible. It is important we find him."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  spokesman added: "If you see Jed please do not approach him. Instead call 999 immediately.'' Allen is a former groundsman at Oxford University and is listed online as an apprentice gardener on Didcot Town Council's website.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  launched the manhunt after the three victims' bodies were discovered following a call to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by a member of the public.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The family had only been living in the house for two months. Neighbour Sheila Welch said that, although she did not know them, they always looked "happy".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 She added: "They are new neighbours and had only been here a couple of months.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I used to see them, a lovely mother and a little girl. They always looked so happy.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "All I can say is that I am very upset, it is all very traumatic.'' A former neighbour who lives near the family's old home, also in Didcot, said Janet used to take Derin cycling.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 She said: "The little girl was always on her bike with her mother. She was really nice. She used to smile and say hello when she saw you in the street.'' Last night tributes to the victims began pouring in. One read: "God bless you all xxx Derrin you beautiful angel xx."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Wolverine is a fictional superhero who first appeared in Marvel Comics in the 1970s.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He is a mutant who possesses animal-keen senses and enhanced physical capabilities. He has been depicted as one of the X-Men, Alpha Flight and The Avengers but has featured in his own solo comic since 1988.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The character has appeared in an animated TV series and video games and was played by Australian Hugh Jackman, 46, in the seven X-Men movies.

\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Pakistan, May 4 -- In the past weeks, the Baltimore, US riots have terrorised the city, forcing the Mayor to institute a curfew and to shut down schools and places of work. Civil rights activists, leaders of the Baltimore black community and the family of the deceased have urged protestors to demonstrate peacefully. The riots broke out after Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old black man sustained a spinal cord injury after being arrested by the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  for carrying a switch-blade. Gray died on April 19, a week after his arrest, which was proved unlawful because the 'switch-blade' that he was allegedly carrying was actually a pocket knife. Although the Baltimore \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Department refused to admit that excessive force had been used, eyewitnesses stated that Gray's injuries had been inflicted by the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  after they chased him down and arrested him. It was also reported that the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  repeatedly refused his pleas for medical care while they were transporting him to jail. On Friday, the Baltimore State Attorney charged the six \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  involved with murder and misconduct charges. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It is unfortunate that the rioting has gotten out of control and that several rioters have had to be arrested but it is important to understand that the people of Baltimore are not just protesting the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of Freddie Gray. There have been countless cases of wrongful arrests and shootings of black men (along with other minorities) in the US, yet these have largely gone unspoken and unheard of. Since the Michael Brown shooting last year however, these cases have been increasingly attracting public attention and sparking outrage and protests from people of all races. These reactions show that the attitude towards African-Americans and other minorities has changed drastically in recent history. Yet, there are still strains of racism left, of which \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  departments countrywide are prime examples. There are many security nets in place for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers'\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  misconduct and a system of proper checks needs to be put in place to prevent the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  from misusing their power and exercising caution whilst approaching and arresting suspects. Most of the cases in which \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have used unnecessary force to unlawfully arrest black men seem to have been motivated by fear that the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suspects\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and dangerous based on the way they look. This fear reflects a mindset that African-Americans are more likely to commit crimes. It is regrettable that it took days of rioting for the Baltimore State Attorney to begin investigating Gray's murder. The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  union of Baltimore and many legislators are still opposed to the charges that the State's Attorney has brought against the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  involved. There were both black and white \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  amongst those charged with Gray's murder, showing that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of all races tend to racially profile African-Americans. The US \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Departments need to rethink their training procedures to make \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  more racially sensitive and less fearful of African-Americans and hold \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  misconduct to a higher degree of accountability.*

Yet, there are still strains of racism left, of which \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  departments countrywide are prime examples. There are many security nets in place for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  misconduct and a system of proper checks needs to be put in place to prevent the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  from misusing their power and exercising caution whilst approaching and arresting suspects. Most of the cases in which \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have used unnecessary force to unlawfully arrest black men seem to have been motivated by fear that the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suspects\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and dangerous based on the way they look. This fear reflects a mindset that African-Americans are more likely to commit crimes. It is regrettable that it took days of rioting for the Baltimore State Attorney to begin investigating Grays murder. The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  union of Baltimore and many legislators are still opposed to the charges that the States Attorney has brought against the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  involved. There were both black and white \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  amongst those charged with Grays murder, showing that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of all races tend to racially profile African-Americans. The US \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Departments need to rethink their training procedures to make \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  more racially sensitive and less fearful of African-Americans and hold \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  misconduct to a higher degree of accountability.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Gauteng \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Lungelo Dlamini said the dead suspect was a resident of a Soweto hostel. He said the man, who was his 20s, died as he was being given breakfast.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 As the gang were fleeing, Diepkloof \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  who were patrolling the area gave chase.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suspect\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has revealed that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  robbery pays better in Kogi than in Lagos State.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Akinropo Ogunsina, 32 and his native doctor accomplice, Jimoh Akeem, are being interrogated at the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) of the Lagos State \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Command.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I was working in a Chinese company before I was sacked.  I bought a motorcycle for commercial.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I also did  black market fuel business. I bought fuel from Ijaw oil pipeline vandals. I paid N2,500 for 50 litres and sold for N3,200." 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He disclosed that when \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were raiding the business premises daily, he abandoned it and joined an armed robbery gang.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I met Sunday David in Agbara area. Then, I used to sleep in a club at Agbara. He said I should be going out with him to tear nets at night and steal people's phones and monies. We were collecting phones, jewelry, laptops and money.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I have gone out for operation six times with Sunday.  We operated in Egbeda and Agbara. We went out for operation about 12 midnight. I was arrested in 2013, and charged to court. I was released on bail. I don't know how much my friends and family spent to get me out of prison.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I went to Okene in Lokoja area of Kogi State.  One guy, Alhaji, who I used to sell stolen phones, gold and laptops to, directed me to Lokoja. He stays in Agege, Lagos. He directed me to meet one Adeshe and work with him. They operated like those people in Lagos."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I spent only one month there and worked for about three times with him. I had a misunderstanding with him over women. He threatened to deal with me, so I came back to Lagos. I have not done any job since I came back to Lagos.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 On some of the properties he acquired with robbery money, Akinropo said he bought a Honda car. When he came out of prison for N680,000. It was the little money with my wife, about N90,000 and the job we did in Okene that I put together to buy the car.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I got over a million Naira from Okene operation.  That is why I said that robbery pays better in Kogi than in Lagos.  In Lagos, people don't keep big money at home, but in Kogi, they keep money at home. Moreso, in Lagos, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  will be chasing you up and down.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "There was a big man we robbed in Okene. The money was so big that I got over a million naira. We were four in number who went for the operation.  I knew Jimoh Akeem in 2010. He disguised as a herbalist.  We were operating together when we were tearing nets.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We were also deceiving and collecting money from people who came to do medicine for gun protection. He also deceived people that he could change fake dollars for good ones. At-times, he gave me N5,000 after doing the herbalist job and the highest he had given me was N10,000," he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 For the self-acclaimed herbalist, Jimoh, 20, he said: "I am married with two children, I have two wives. I once lived in Ikorodu and later in Iwo. I built a house in Iwo. I have two cars, Murano SUV and KIA Altima.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I stole fake dollars from the man who asked me to change it for him. That was how I started using it. I have gone out for net-tearing-robbery operation with the gang for four times."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He, however, said that unlike his colleague, he had not gone to prisons before as he was never arrested.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I got peanuts from the three operations I have gone out with the gang. I got N70,000, N80,000 and N100,000.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Lagos State \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  spokesman, Kenneth Nwosu, confirmed the arrest of the duo.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said Akinropo had also been arrested in 2013 for robbery and charged to court, but was released in 2014.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to him, Akinropo led SARS team to arrest Jimoh in Iwo, Osun State.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said one locally-made gun was recovered in Jimoh's house.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 By LUKMAN OLABIYI
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A suit filed by Mr. Bashir Junaid, a former political associate of National Leader of All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu,  seeking fresh investigations into the murder of the governorship aspirant, Funsho Williams, has been struck out.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The suit was dismissed on Wednesday by a Federal High Court sitting in Lagos presided over by Justice Rita Ofili-Ajumogobia, following an application based on want of diligent prosecution.  The court also awarded N25,000  cost  against Junaid. He is to pay the money to the Inspector-General of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  (IGP) and the Attorney- General of the Federation, who had asked the court to strike out the matter with cost.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Williams, an aspirant of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), was on July 27, 2006 strangled to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  at his residence, 34A Corporation Drive, Dolphin Estate, Ikoyi, Lagos.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A Lagos High Court sitting in Igbosere had, on June 30, 2014,  discharged six accused persons charged with the murder.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 They are Bulama Kolo, Musa Maina, David Cassidy, Tunani Sonani, Mustapha Kayode and Okponwasa Imariebie, who were freed eight years after by retired Justice Ebenezer Adebajo, who held that the prosecution failed to establish a prima facie case against them.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Junaid filed the fresh application seeking an order of mandamus compelling the Inspector-General of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to re-open investigations into the assassination, with the hope of possible fresh trial.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In the suit, he had fingered as a prime suspect, Tinubu, against whom the late Williams had been racing for the office of governor before his killing.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Other defendants were the APC Legal Adviser, Dr. Muiz Banire; Mr. B[#x430]b[#x430]tund[#x435] Edu; Mr. Dele Al[#x430]k[#x435],  Mr[#x455].M[#x43e]du[#x440][#x435] Shasore and Ol[#x430]d[#x435]l[#x435] Aj[#x43e]m[#x430]l[#x435], Lagos State APC Chairman.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Others were the IGP, the Attorney-General of Lagos State and the Lagos Commissioner of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 When the matter was called on Wednesday, the plaintiff's counsel, Miss O.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But Ofili-Ajumogobia, who did not take kindly to the comment, disagreed.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 By CHRISTOPHER OJI
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Esan Renaissance Union (ERU) Edo State chapter, has commended President Goodluck Jonathan for appointing Mr Solomon Arase, one their kinsmen, as the new Acting Inspector-General of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  (IGP).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 President of the group, Mr Aigbefo Irieteoshe Jnr had at a conference,  said the appointment of Mr. Arase was very much in order. In a statement jointly signed by the union president and secretary, Messrs  Irieteoshe and Jude.  Ihichoya, the union condemned a former IGP, Ibrahim  Coomassie for attacking President Goodluck Jonathan over the removal of the former \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  boss, Mr Suleiman Abba, saying the former's statement was not good for democracy.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "In as much as others, like former Presidents Olusegun Obasanjo and the late Shehu Umaru Yar'Adua hired and fired other men who were IGPs,  Jonathan has the right to appoint and fire IGPs"
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The union disclosed that if given the necessary logistics and support by the Federal Government, Arase, by his pedigree would deliver.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Similarly, a security analyst, Mr Folorunsho Atta has said Arase's appointment came at a time when the nation needed  a transformer for the incoming  government of  Gen. Muhammadu Buhari.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Arase had always proved that he has what it takes to not only move the force to the next level, but make it the best in Africa."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  A HEAVILY \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  policeman alleged to have killed three murder suspects is on the run.  
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The detective was based at Springs \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  station, on the East Rand. He is believed to be armed with his state-issued R5 rifle and hundreds of rounds of ammunition.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0   He fled as other \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempted to arrest him.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  His service pistol was recently taken from him because he was under investigation for misconduct.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  He went on the run after being alerted to his imminent arrest.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  His partner and two informants were arrested on Tuesday.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  The two policemen are allegedly responsible for murdering three \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suspects\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in several \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  robbery and murder investigations.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  The bodies of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suspects\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , one of whom had been beaten to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were found on Monday hidden in a field near the West Rand mining town of Carletonville.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  Two of the suspects had been shot.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  Moses Dlamini, spokesman for the Independent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Investigative Directorate, said the directorate had taken over the murder investigations from the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  He said the alleged murders were disclosed by an informant who was with the two policemen when they allegedly killed the suspects.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  "He took [intelligence] agents to the field where the bodies were found," said Dlamini.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  A fourth suspect, he said, had been shot but survived. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  "The policemen apparently wanted to kill all the men to cover up what they had done."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  Moses Dlamini, spokesman for the Independent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Investigative Directorate, said the directorate had taken over the murder investigations from the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  He said the alleged murders were disclosed by an informant who was with the two policemen when they allegedly killed the suspects.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  "He took [intelligence] agents to the field where the bodies were found," said Dlamini.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  A fourth suspect, he said, had been shot but survived. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  "The policemen apparently wanted to kill all the men to cover up what they had done."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The wounded suspect was rushed into surgery and hospitalized in critical condition following the shooting, which took place about 5:30 a.m. at Valley Boulevard and Mountain View Road , Los Angeles \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Lt. John Jenal said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The incident began two hours earlier, when \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  from the LAPD s Southeast Division responded to a report of a domestic assault in the are of 96th Street and Firth Avenue, the lieutenant said. They encountered a victim with significant injuries, but the suspect had already left.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  spotted the suspect driving a white Toyota minivan nearby and began a pursuit when he failed to pull over, Jenal said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The slow speed chase continued for about two hours, primarily on surface streets, Jenal said.  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  saw him waving a weapon. 
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  used a spike strip to flatten the minivans wheels, but the suspect continued driving on the van s rims.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He stopped the minivan and exited at Elliot Avenue and Cogswell Road, Jenal said. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  first shot at the man with a bean bag gun before opening fire with bullets, he said. The suspect, who was not struck by the gunfire, returned to the minivan and continued driving.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The minivan again came to a stop, apparently disabled, at Valley Boulevard and Mountain View Road.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  He put a blanket over him as he exited the van, to the point where you could not see his hands,  Jenal said.  Shortly thereafter, the blanket fell to the ground. In his hand, he brandished that same handgun, that s when the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -involved shooting occurred. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Jenal said the suspect suffered multiple gunshot wounds and was in  very critical condition  at an intensive care unit. His identity was not available. He was initially described as about 30 years old.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 No \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were hurt, officials said.

\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 EL MONTE >> Los Angeles \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shot and critically wounded an \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  domestic violence \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suspect\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in El Monte early Friday at the conclusion of a two-hour car chase that began in South Los Angeles, authorities said. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The wounded suspect was rushed into surgery and hospitalized in critical condition following the shooting, which took place about 5:30 a.m. at Valley Boulevard and Mountain View Road , Los Angeles \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Lt. John Jenal said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The incident began two hours earlier, when \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  from the LAPD s Southeast Division responded to a report of a domestic assault in the are of 96th Street and Firth Avenue, the lieutenant said. They encountered a victim with significant injuries, but the suspect had already left.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  spotted the suspect driving a white Toyota minivan nearby and began a pursuit when he failed to pull over, Jenal said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The slow speed chase continued for about two hours, primarily on surface streets, Jenal said.  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  saw him waving a weapon. 
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  used a spike strip to flatten the minivans wheels, but the suspect continued driving on the van s rims.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He stopped the minivan and exited at Elliot Avenue and Cogswell Road, Jenal said. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  first shot at the man with a bean bag gun before opening fire with bullets, he said. The suspect, who was not struck by the gunfire, returned to the minivan and continued driving.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The minivan again came to a stop, apparently disabled, at Valley Boulevard and Mountain View Road.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  He put a blanket over him as he exited the van, to the point where you could not see his hands,  Jenal said.  Shortly thereafter, the blanket fell to the ground. In his hand, he brandished that same handgun, that s when the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -involved shooting occurred. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Jenal said the suspect suffered multiple gunshot wounds and was in  very critical condition  at an intensive care unit. His identity was not available. He was initially described as about 30 years old.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 No \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were hurt, officials said.

\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Lt. Brad Shannon anticipates members of the Dubuque \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Department's tactical team will receive more calls than usual in the months leading up to the U.S. presidential election.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Shannon, who is taking over as head of the tactical entry team, said the team's duties include assisting Secret Service when dignitaries - primarily political candidates or sitting presidents and vice presidents - make stops in Dubuque.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "With a presidential election, we can get called a lot," Shannon said. "We assist with whatever they require." 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Shannon and other entry team members recently completed their 10-hour monthly training at the law enforcement shooting range north of Dubuque. A key component of that training involves marksmanship, though members also practice entry approaches, clearing buildings and other scenarios.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Entry team
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Dubuque \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Department's tactical team actually is comprised of three different teams, according to Assistant \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Chief Terry Tobin. Along with the entry team, the department also has \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  trained for the rifle/observer team and the negotiation team.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The entry team has 12 members overseen by a lieutenant and a captain, and the rifle/observer and negotiation teams each have six members overseen by a lieutenant.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Tobin said the tactical entry team is primarily called for serving arrest and search warrants when the people involved are considered dangerous. Tobin said team members also are trained to search for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed suspects\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  who have fled into wooded areas. There also are three paramedic firefighters that can accompany the entry team to calls.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In 2012, the entry and rifle/observer teams assisted with visits from President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Tobin said the presidential candidates generally do not receive Secret Service details unless they are a nominated candidate or there are threats against them early in the campaign.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "When Obama first ran, he got Secret Service right away because of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  threats," Tobin said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Should a dignitary be targeted in an attack, the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  department's teams would immediately stage in that area and handle the threat while Secret Service rushes the politician away from that area, Tobin said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Rifle/observer team
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Tobin said the rifle/observer team also completes about 10 hours of training per month and can function as snipers. But the team's primary use is to gather intelligence during investigations.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "They're also responsible for pre-raid surveillance and observation of the target area to get us intelligence before \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  move in," Tobin said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Department records show the entry and rifle/observer teams responded to the same nine calls in 2014, most of which were for search warrants for guns or narcotics. The two teams have assisted on one search warrant so far in 2015, and the entry team and negotiators assisted U.S. Marshals in arresting a federal fugitive.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Negotiation team
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Tobin said the negotiation team does not have set monthly training, though members will attend out-of-town training sessions when feasible and will meet every few months to talk about recent incidents and review procedures.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Members of the negotiation team will respond for people who have barricaded themselves or have taken hostages with the threat to harm themselves or others.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Department statistics show the team was called out once in 2012 for an arrest warrant with a dangerous person, as well as once in 2013 to assist in arresting an \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  domestic-assault \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suspect\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Continuous training
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Because the teams often work in tandem, they will also have full group training at least once per year, Tobin said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "That generally will be scenario- type training that they'll work through," Tobin said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Tobin said because the teams are not regularly needed, team members also work in other areas of the department, including as patrol \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  criminal investigation \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and school resource \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Shannon, who has been on the tactical entry team for almost 10 years, said a key component of monthly training is repetition of different shooting positions, both to keep marksmanship sharp and to ingrain the movements in each \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  mind. "We want it to be muscle memory," Shannon said. "They need to know how to react."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Tobin said some citizens might not realize the department has a tactical response team, which actually is the point. Tobin said the teams are designed to use the element of surprise and to move quickly and quietly to get the job done.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We don't always use the full complement of teams either," Tobin said. "When we deploy the teams, we want to draw the least amount of attention possible. We try to be low-key."

\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 THE FAMILY of a man who was shot and killed at Mamelodi West hostel say they fear that those responsible for the killing may not be held accountable.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Class Modiba died while walking down a passage in the hostel when \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were conducting a crime prevention operation. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This was in contrast to what witnesses claimed; that Modiba was killed by a rogue \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  who was extorting money from gamblers in the hostel.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Modiba's brother, Jack, said very little had been done regarding the investigations as witnesses were afraid to come forward with information regarding the shooting.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "People are scared to come forward with information about what happened. The investigating \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  said witnesses were reluctant to give statements, because they were scared that the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  who shot Modiba might come back for them since he had not been arrested," said Jack.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Modiba, who was a resident at the hostel, was described as a peaceful man by his brother. He was shot and killed on Saturday, May 23. Witnesses said he was hit by a stray bullet fired by a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Zizi Selala, one of the witnesses, said at the time that Modiba was shot after a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempted and failed to solicit a bribe from him.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Selala alleged the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  harassed them daily and arrested them unlawfully.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Selala said after they refused to give the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  a bribe, an argument ensued and the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  pulled out his gun and fired randomly. One of the bullets, Selala alleged, hit Modiba and killed him.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Lungile Dlamini refuted the claim, saying the shooting occurred when an \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  man attempted to free \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suspects\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  who had been arrested during the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  operation.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said a case of murder was being investigated, but no arrests had been made.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Modiba said the family opened a case with the Independent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Investigative Directorate (Ipid) but no arrests had been made.

\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Five suspected militants were killed in an alleged encounter when they attacked the convoy of the former Malir senior superintendent of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  on Saturday evening in the same area where a deputy superintendent of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  along with his guard and driver was gunned down a day earlier. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Former Malir-SSP Rao Anwar Ahmed Khan told Dawn that he was going to examine the crime scene in Gulshan-i-Hadeed where Bin Qasim DSP Abdul Fatah Sangri was killed on Friday.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said that due to lack of proper security, he had not visited the crime scene on Friday.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  said armed men riding three motorbikes and travelling in a car lobbed a hand grenade and opened fire on his vehicle when his convoy was on the link road between the National Highway and the Superhighway. He said he and other officials travelling in the armoured personnel carrier of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  remained unhurt. In retaliatory fire opened by his \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  guards, the car driver was killed on the spot, he said. As the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suspects\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  tried to flee, his guards \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  with G-3 rifles took positions and killed four of them, while an equal number of suspects managed to escape, the SSP said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Rao Anwar claimed to have seized the car, one motorcycle, weapons and hand grenades from their custody.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  said the identity of the suspects, who sported beards, could not be ascertained immediately though the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  said he believed they were militants.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The SSP said the dead men could have links with the banned militant outfits as he said he had been facing threat from the Al-Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS) and different groups of the outlawed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan such as the Shaharyar group and the Sajna group.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was transferred on Thursday night following his press conference in which the Muttahida Qaumi Movement was accused of its involvement in terrorist activities. The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  chief removed him from the position on the charge of misusing his authority, after Chief Minister Syed Qaim Ali Shah had taken serious notice of the press conference and sought a report from the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  chief on the matter within 24 hours.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Meanwhile, Karachi-East DIG Munir Ahmed Shaikh told Dawn that the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  investigators found some leads to the targeted killing of DSP Bin Qasim Fatah Sangri, head constable Nazeer Ahmed and constable Farooq Ahmed.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said sketches of the assailants had been prepared with the help of witnesses. The investigators also had obtained footage to examine and identify the attackers who must have done a recce before targeting the DSP.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The senior \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  recalled that in 2001 nine policemen had been gunned down in the same area of Gulshan-i-Hadeed. He said the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  investigators were trying to ascertain if the Friday morning attack had any links with that incident.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In reply to a question, the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  said the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in their initial findings suspected involvement of banned militant outfits in the killing of the DSP, his guard and driver.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "DSP Sangri may not have taken active part against the militants, but he might have been targeted for being a senior \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officer,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 " said the DIG East.

\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A man suspected of assaulting a woman in South Los Angeles was shot by LAPD \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  after a two-hour pursuit that ended in El Monte.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The suspect, whose name has not been released, was wounded during the second of two shootings that happened in the San Gabriel Valley city. LAPD \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Matt Ludwig said the man had a gun. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Ludwig said two \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  responded about 1 a.m. Friday to a domestic violence call in the 9300 block of Firth Boulevard. The two \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were speaking with the female victim when they noticed the male suspect driving away in a white Toyota minivan.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "They attempted to do a traffic stop, but he did not stop and a pursuit started," Ludwig said. The chase was at low speeds, he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "At some point during the pursuit, he called CHP and notified them that he was \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 " Ludwig said of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suspect\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Once in El Monte, the man stopped the minivan at Cogwell Road and Elliot Avenue and got out. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  opened fire.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 LAPD Lt. John Jenal said it was unclear what exactly happened during that shooting, but he said there was no initial evidence to suggest that the man had been struck. The suspect got back into his vehicle and drove off.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Ludwig said \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  used a spike strip to disable and stop the minivan, but the man continued driving with flat tires. The minivan came to a stop about half a mile away from the scene of the first shooting, at Mountain View Road and Valley Boulevard.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The man got out of the vehicle holding a blanket. He dropped it at one point and brandished a gun, according to Jenal and Ludwig. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  fired again.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The suspect was taken to a hospital, where he remains in critical condition, Ludwig said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Jenal called the incident "very complex" and said the investigations into both \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -involved shootings -- routine after such incidents -- were in their preliminary stages. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  said no \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were injured.

\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 May 19--A Ju\'e1rez \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was arrested Monday in connection with the execution-style shooting of four people three years ago, the Chihuahua state attorney general's office said. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Jose Luis Arreola Rodriguez, who had been a bodyguard to then Ju\'e1rez \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  chief Julian Leyzaola Perez, is accused of taking part in the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 deaths\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of three young men and a woman found April 24, 2012 near the San Rafael cemetery in the outskirts of Ju\'e1rez, officials said in a news release.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Arreola faces four homicide charges and an attempted murder charge as part of an investigation that officials said could lead to more arrests.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The arrest comes three days after Leyzaola, who was wounded in a May 8 shooting in Ju\'e1rez, told the Zeta newspaper in Tijuana that a gunman told him before pulling the trigger that the shooting was a "message" from current \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  chief Jesus Antonio Reyes, who has denied the allegations.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Chihuahua attorney general's office said that Arreola's arrest follows a recommendation made last month by the National Commission on Human Rights asking for an investigation into Leyzaola and the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  department.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 State prosecutors identified those killed in 2012 as Alejandro Martinez Rodriguez, 16, Jesus Efrain Rodriguez Gavirio, 17, Jose Juan Villanueva Leal, 18, and Veronica Cerros Olivas, 22. Prosecutors said a woman survived by pretending to be dead after being wounded.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The survivor told investigators that the group was detained by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  at a park and were beaten because one of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suspects\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was allegedly \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  officials said. After being driven around, they were taken to dirt road near the cemetery and made to kneel with their heads covered.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The survivor told investigators she heard one of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  say "shoot each one three times in the head" but she was not shot because she pretended to be dead, officials said. The woman later walked through the desert and got help at the customs checkpoint on the Panamerican Highway.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Monterey >> \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are on the hunt for a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suspect\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  considered to be \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and dangerous after a male transient was stabbed to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  late Thursday behind the Monterey Public Library. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The unidentified 40-year-old was getting ready to go to sleep in an outdoor quad area behind the library when an altercation ensued, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  said. A 22-year-old male transient was also stabbed during the fight but survived.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  identified Jesse Quiming, 32, as the sole suspect in the double-stabbing. Quiming is not in custody and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  say he is considered armed and dangerous. They are asking that citizens do not approach him, but instead to call 911 if seen.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Quiming was identified as the suspect following statements from witnesses, including the younger victim, and further investigation of the crime scene, Monterey \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Lt. Marty Hart said. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Just before midnight, a resident near the library flagged down an \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to report a "disturbance" behind the library. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  arrived within minutes and found the 40-year-old unconscious and not breathing. The 22-year-old sustained non-life-threatening injuries and was talking to paramedics on his way to Natividad Medical Center. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Monterey Fire Division Chief Stewart Rothe said the 22-year-old's hands were also injured. The victim said the cuts were a result of him trying to defend himself from the attacker.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A motive for the double-stabbing is not yet known, and a weapon has not been recovered, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The library was closed for about six hours on Friday as the quad area was cleaned up and investigators collected more evidence from the scene. Droplets of blood were splattered in an area of the library that is usually safe and welcoming, said library director Bill Michael.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "This is our home," Michael said. "(Transients) are part of our community, they are human beings. People may get in an argument, but never violence." 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Michael said transients frequent the library just as much as kids and adults, adding that the library "serves everyone." He said he wants to assure the community that despite the "tragic" \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  late Thursday, the library, which closes at 8 p.m. at the latest and is located directly in front of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and fire departments, is a "very safe place to visit."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Quiming, who has a criminal record on the Monterey Peninsula, is a transient who frequents the Monterey area. Although he remains at large, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  believe he remains nearby.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This is the third homicide in Monterey this year. The two previous killings were also stabbing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 deaths.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Anyone with information about the incident is asked to call Detective Bryan Kurse at 646-3812.
\par \b0 \i \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Ana Ceballos can be reached at 726-4377.\b0 \i0 \ul0

\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This extraordinary video shows the moment Charleston church shooting \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suspect\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Dylann Roof was arrested by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed police.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Cops can be seen following a black car after receiving a call from somebody suspecting that the man who allegedly killed nine innocent churchgoers was inside.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Video footage from the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  dashboard camera shows cops pull over the suspected racist gunman in Shelby, North Carolina. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 One \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  then pulls Roof - who had been on the run for 14 hours - out of the vehicle before he is frisked. Despite being the centre of a huge \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  manhunt both the cops and Roof seem remarkably relaxed.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Eventually Roof is placed in a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  car before a group of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  show their relief by high-fiving each other.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It has since emerged that Roof was given a Burger King meal by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  after his arrest.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The confessed killer told \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  who seized him he was hungry and had not eaten since before the attack.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  chief Jeff Ledford said they bought him food from a nearby Burger King .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "He was very quiet, very calm. He didn't talk," Ledford said. "He sat very quietly."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Hours after shooting nine churchgoers dead, racist gunman Dylann Roof was treated to a Burger King meal by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The confessed killer complained of being hungry following his arrest after carrying out his massacre at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina last Wednesday.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 After the shooting he fled in his black Hyundai car 250 miles north where he was finally apprehended in Shelby after 14 hours on the run.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Now the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  chief whose \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  arrested Roof has revealed cops bought him a Burger King meal after he said he hadn't eaten since carrying out the assault.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Jeff Ledford said the killer refused to answer any question put to him by his staff and that the only conversation he had was about food.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Ledford said \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  bought him food from a nearby Burger King. "He was very quiet, very calm. He didn't talk," Ledford said. "He sat down here very quietly. He was not problematic."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Roof had been found with .45-calibre handgun in his car and told armed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  "I am Dylann Roof" when he was arrested.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He is reported to have shown no remorse and expressed racist views as he later confessed to the crime to the FBI.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The gunman has since been charged with nine counts of murder and possession of a firearm in the commission of of violent crime.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 If found guilty prosecutors as well as South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley have said they will seek the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  penalty.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It comes as the relatives Roof's victim told him during his first court appearance on Friday they forgave him for the killings.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Many have said they would not want him sent to the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  chamber.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Roof is currently being held in solitary confinement, where he is under 24-hour watch and only allowed out of his cell for 60 minutes a day.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 As yet he has had no visits from his family or friends with the only person who has talked to him has being his lawyer.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 His cell is next to the one holding former cop Michael Slager - the policeman accused of gunning down unarmed black man Walter Scott in April.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Roof, 21, is in cell 1141B at Charleston County Jail.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Slager, 33, who was seen on video shooting Mr Scott in the back, is in 1140B.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Sources at the Sheriff Al Cannon Detention Centre have said the two killers can talk to each other through shouting but both have refused.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Roof is sitting quietly in his cell and not saying a word," said the insider.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The only person he has conversed with is his lawyer.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It seems everyone else has washed their hands of him.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "He remains on suicide watch."

\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  BODY:
\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  on Friday claimed to have arrested three suspects outside the Defence residence of former home minister Dr Zulfikar Mirza and booked them for possessing illegal weapons, storming the Darakhshan \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  station and harassing policemen when the disgruntled PPP leader went there to record his statement. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 SSP-Central Chaudhry Asad Ali, who has been given the additional responsibility of SSP-South, claimed that a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  patrol arrested the three suspects Naik Mohammed, Sikander Ali Brohi and Mohammed Ibrahim and seized as many unlicensed sub-machine guns from them.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said a case was registered against the suspects at the Darakhshan \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  station and during initial investigation they "disclosed that Dr Mirza provided them [the seized] weapons".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The SSP said that suspect Ibrahim was allegedly associated with the Lyari gang warfare.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Talking to Dawn, Darakhshan SHO Abdul Moid said that the former home minister would also be questioned in the light of the disclosures of the held suspects.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Earlier, several \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  vans besieged the residence of the former home minister and detained three of his supporters outside his house.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mirza planning to go abroad on 30th
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Later, Dr Mirza told reporters at his residence that the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  had detained his guard, driver and a servant. The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  had staged a drama outside his home by deploying over 20 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  mobile vans including armoured personnel carriers, he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He alleged that a conspiracy had been hatched to kill him in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  custody and for this purpose, the task had been given to a senior \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  who would administer him a lethal injection once he was inside an APC, which might cause his \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said that the special security unit (SSU) of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was created to fight terrorism during his tenure as the home minister but now it had been reduced to providing security to VIPs, their families and friends.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In an apparent reference to the alleged removal of SSP-South Tariq Dharejo and some other \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  officials, Dr Mirza said that honest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  had been removed because they refused to arrest him.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He launched personal attacks on the chief minister of Sindh and the newly appointed home minister and said he had got bail in all cases.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He proposed if \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  had any new case against him, the DIG and the SSP-South should come to him with an arrest warrant and he would surrender to them like any "law-abiding citizen".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Otherwise, he warned the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  could not arrest him through "high-handed tactics" as he had 30-40 guards loyal to him who were willing to sacrifice their lives to save his.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He hoped the judiciary would provide him justice and disclosed that he was planning to leave the country on May 30 for the treatment of his wife, former speaker of the National Assembly Dr Fahmida Mirza, and said he would inform the media before departure.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said that he would visit the shrines of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Shahnawaz Bhutto, Mir Murtaza Bhutto and Benazir Bhutto after returning from abroad and would wage jihad by launching a mass awareness campaign.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In response to a question, he hinted at contesting next general election from PPPs platform provided Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari assumed leadership of the party.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Hundreds of people packed Xavier University's Cintas Center to honor 48-year-old \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Sonny Kim. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  say the 27-year veteran was killed June 19 by an \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed suspect\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  who had made 911 calls and was seeking "suicide by cop." The suspect was killed by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 City Manager Harry Black called Kim a "true hero" and a model \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mayor John Cranley said the shooting was an act of evil.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We have a lot of questions for God today. Our faith is being tested," Cranley said. "Why did the good guy lose?"

Kim was promoted to the rank of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in 1988 and received 22 commendations in his career.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Kim loved Cincinnati and its people and was proud to serve them, said his brother, Mickey Kim.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "He was so proud to wear that uniform," he said. "He was so proud to be part of that fraternity."

Los Angeles County prosecutors said Nathan Campbell, 39, was angry about a soured drug deal and deliberately targeted vendors and tourists on the popular walkway. Campbell was found guilty in the August 2013 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of Alice Gruppioni. Campbell was also found guilty of 10 counts of leaving the scene of an accident and 17 counts of assault with a deadly weapon.

It wasn't immediately known how many passengers were aboard the train.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A university \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Baltimore shot and wounded a man who was reported to be carrying a knife on campus yesterday, authorities said. The man is being treated at a hospital for what was believed to be a non-life-threatening injury to a leg, a Baltimore \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  spokesman said. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  from the University of Maryland, Baltimore, searched for the man after a 911 call shortly after 1 p.m. reporting an armed person on campus. Additional 911 callers also reported seeing a man holding a knife, Jackson said. Two uniformed university \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  found the man nearby, off campus. "He was observed openly wielding a knife," and then reached into his waistband, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  said. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were concerned about the knife and believed the man might be reaching for a gun, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  said, and at least one \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  fired.

\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 MISHAWAKA -- \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  found two toddlers wandering a Mishawaka street Friday morning near the place where their mother was shot and killed during an apparent domestic dispute moments earlier. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Lt. David Wells, assistant commander of the St. Joseph County Metro Homicide Unit, said \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  responded late Friday morning to the 1200 block of Sixth Street, just east of Logan Street, after they received a 911 call about a reported shooting.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There, they found a woman, later identified as 22-year-old Precious Jackson, lying in the street with a gunshot wound. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  named 18-year-old Tyron Devon Johnson as the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suspect\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the shooting.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Johnson, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  with a semi-automatic handgun, ran north from the scene, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  said. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were trying to track him with dogs Friday afternoon. They said Johnson should be considered armed and dangerous, and anyone who sees him should immediately call \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Jackson and Johnson also had a 1-month-old baby together. The two toddlers were found standing in the street. All three children were taken into custody. The Department of Child Services will be in charge of their placement, Wells said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Wayne Zimmer who lives near the intersection of Sixth Street and Cleveland, said Jackson and Johnson were walking down the street, toward Johnson's mother's house, moments before the shooting.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Zimmer said the pair had just gotten off the Eighth Street bus and were walking in the rain with the children in tow. He said he came outside when he heard them arguing and watched as they continued down the street. He went back inside when he lost sight of them.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 That's when Zimmer heard several gunshots ring out. He said he ran outside and saw Jackson lying in the street.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 As \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  swarmed the scene, two women consoled another woman who was wailing and sobbing, and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  had McDonald's Happy Meals delivered to the scene to feed children who were stranded inside the crime scene while their parents waited outside the yellow tape.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Later, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  guarding the crime scene turned away a man who said he was Jackson's brother. The man angrily shouted that the suspect ran to a local apartment complex, and demanded that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  go to the complex and arrest "any (expletive) you find."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 If officially ruled a homicide, the shooting would be Mishawaka's first killing of 2015, but it would make the 10th killing recorded in St. Joseph County this year, according to Tribune archives, and the second \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 fatal\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shooting this week.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are also still looking for 18-year-old Marqwan Beserra, who is suspected in a shooting that left 21-year-old Jerry Wright dead Tuesday evening in the 2400 block of West Frederickson Street in South Bend.

\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A Jucrez \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was arrested Monday in connection with the execution-style shooting of four people three years ago, the Chihuahua state attorney general's office said. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Jose Luis Arreola Rodriguez, who had been a bodyguard to then Jucrez \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  chief Julian Leyzaola Perez, is accused of taking part in the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 deaths\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of three young men and a woman found April 24, 2012 near the San Rafael cemetery in the outskirts of Jucrez, officials said in a news release.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Arreola faces four homicide charges and an attempted murder charge as part of an investigation that officials said could lead to more arrests.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The arrest comes three days after Leyzaola, who was wounded in a May 8 shooting in Jucrez, told the Zeta newspaper in Tijuana that a gunman told him before pulling the trigger that the shooting was a "message" from current \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  chief Jesus Antonio Reyes, who has denied the allegations.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Chihuahua attorney general's office said that Arreola's arrest follows a recommendation made last month by the National Commission on Human Rights asking for an investigation into Leyzaola and the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  department.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 State prosecutors identified those killed in 2012 as Alejandro Martinez Rodriguez, 16, Jesus Efrain Rodriguez Gavirio, 17, Jose Juan Villanueva Leal, 18, and Veronica Cerros Olivas, 22. Prosecutors said a woman survived by pretending to be dead after being wounded.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The survivor told investigators that the group was detained by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  at a park and were beaten because one of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suspects\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was allegedly \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  officials said. After being driven around, they were taken to dirt road near the cemetery and made to kneel with their heads covered.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The survivor told investigators she heard one of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  say "shoot each one three times in the head" but she was not shot because she pretended to be dead, officials said. The woman later walked through the desert and got help at the customs checkpoint on the Panamerican Highway.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  Niemand died in the middle of the four-lane Uitenhage Road in Sydenham where he had been in a scuffle with the men, one of whom shot him before fleeing. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  Niemand, who was yesterday hailed as a hero and a good Samaritan, had managed to recover the stolen property which, unbeknown to the suspects, consisted of a virtually empty laptop bag and a few rands in cash. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  The drama started just minutes before in Commercial Road, an extension of Uitenhage Road, when a self-employed western suburbs man, George Carr, 45, had finished conducting his business at Don's Pawn shop there.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  After leaving the shop with his laptop bag, Carr was about to get into his vehicle when he was approached by two men, one of who attempted to grab his bag. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  A shaken Carr said he had hung onto his bag until one of the suspects produced a handgun and thrust it into his face. "Then I just let go and hit the floor. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  "The two guys started running down the road with my bag and then jumped over a railing to get onto Uitenhage Road," Carr said. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  There was not much in the bag as he had already made a large payment inside the store.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  Carr said he jumped into his car and proceeded to chase the two men through oncoming traffic down Commercial Road and into Uitenhage Road. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  Two men in a black Volkswagen Golf, who had also been at the shop, also gave chase.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  "When I got into Uitenhage Road, I saw the two guys. I saw some other people in a scuffle with them. I heard a shot go off. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  "It turns out that this poor man [Niemand] was driving past and saw the guys running with the bag. He jumped out to help catch them and was shot just like that. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  "He is a bloody hero, this guy. I am so, so very sorry that he has died. I am still shaking inside." 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  Port Elizabeth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  spokesman Warrant \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Alwin Labans said one of the two suspects, 25, was arrested at the scene.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  He said the second suspect, who is believed to have fired the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 fatal\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shot, was known to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and they expected to arrest him soon. Labans said an armed robbery and a murder docket had been opened. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  According to a friend of Niemand's, Morne Lottering, 20, who was at the scene, Niemand lived and worked at the nearby Propshaft Centre.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0   He said he was "a great guy" who had spent the last few years successfully getting his life back on track after difficult times.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  Propshaft Centre owner Jan Serfontein last night echoed Lottering's sentiments and described Niemand as a person who was always happy and willing to help at any time.

\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A two-month manhunt for a former LAPD \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  accused of murder ended Tuesday when the 27-year-old was arrested in Mexico, authorities said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Chihuahua state authorities said Henry Solis resisted arrest, but no shots were fired when he was apprehended in Juarez, across the Rio Grande from El Paso.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Solis told authorities he knew his capture was coming "sooner or later," Mexican officials said at a news conference. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 One state \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  official said Solis was "hidden among relatives" in the
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 El Mezquital neighborhood where he was arrested.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The official, Pablo Ernesto Rocha Acosta, didn't give specifics about what led investigators to the neighborhood, saying only that Solis' capture was the result of technology, field work and the exchange of information with United States authorities.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Solis was deported to the U.S. on Tuesday evening and will be held in federal custody in El Paso, according to FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Solis had been the target of an international manhunt after a warrant was issued for his arrest, alleging that he shot and killed Salome Rodriguez Jr. in downtown Pomona while off-duty during the early morning hours of March 13.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In the days that followed, Solis was fired from the Los Angeles \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Department and his father charged with lying to federal investigators about his son's whereabouts.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 On Tuesday, Rodriguez's mother welcomed the news of Solis' arrest.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Lidia Rodriguez said she had kept a nightly vigil in the parking lot where her wounded son collapsed, praying federal agents would find the man accused of killing him.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "If it's true he got caught, hallelujah!" she said. "We think this is God's work."

\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A two-month manhunt for a former LAPD \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  accused of murder ended Tuesday when the 27-year-old was arrested in Mexico, authorities said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Chihuahua state authorities said Henry Solis resisted arrest, but no shots were fired when he was apprehended in Juarez, across the Rio Grande from El Paso.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Solis told authorities he knew his capture was coming "sooner or later," Mexican officials said at a news conference. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 One state \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  official said Solis was "hidden among relatives" in the
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 El Mezquital neighborhood where he was arrested.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The official, Pablo Ernesto Rocha Acosta, didn't give specifics about what led investigators to the neighborhood, saying only that Solis' capture was the result of technology, field work and the exchange of information with United States authorities.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Solis was deported to the U.S. on Tuesday evening and will be held in federal custody in El Paso, according to FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Solis had been the target of an international manhunt after a warrant was issued for his arrest, alleging that he shot and killed Salome Rodriguez Jr. in downtown Pomona while off-duty during the early morning hours of March 13.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In the days that followed, Solis was fired from the Los Angeles \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Department and his father charged with lying to federal investigators about his son's whereabouts.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 On Tuesday, Rodriguez's mother welcomed the news of Solis' arrest.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Lidia Rodriguez said she had kept a nightly vigil in the parking lot where her wounded son collapsed, praying federal agents would find the man accused of killing him.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "If it's true he got caught, hallelujah!" she said. "We think this is God's work."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Solis, a former Marine who served a tour in combat in Iraq had spent nine months with the LAPD before authorities allege that he became involved in some kind of dispute with Rodriguez at a Pomona bar, then chased him and shot him.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Kevin W. Jones, 48, appeared before Niagara County Judge Matthew J. Murphy III Tuesday and asked for a hearing rather than conceding he is the wanted man. He is charged with a homicide that occurred March 23.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Buffalo News reported that on Dec. 9, 2011, Jones was charged with third-degree criminal mischief, resisting arrest and obstructing governmental administration after he allegedly threw a small dresser through the front window of his mother's house on LaSalle Avenue after barricading himself inside; he was intoxicated at the time.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Asked where Jones was between then and May 1 of this year, Assistant Public Defender Michael E. Benedict said he wouldn't answer that question at this time. The bail-jumping charge is due to be presented to a local grand jury while the criminal mischief case is pending in Niagara Falls City Court, with the next appearance scheduled for July 15. Jones is being held without bail in Niagara County Jail.

\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 May 16--Victoria \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  deployed their SWAT team members and an armored protection vehicle Friday morning to arrest three men suspected in a string of crimes involving home invasions, controlled substances, theft and the possession of stolen property. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The heavy equipment along with the smoke distraction devices attracted the attention of several neighbors as \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  converged on a home at 8 a.m. in the 3900 block of North Main Street.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Richard Willetts, who lives in the neighborhood, said he was on his way to Inez when his wife called him about a mattress burning on the lawn next door.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "There was an armored car and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  walking all around," Willetts said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Willetts' son, Griffin Milberger, arrived with his father on the scene as the military-style tank was pulling out of their neighbor's driveway.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "They blew out almost every window in the facility, and it's barely a two-bedroom cabin," said Milberger. "They (the SWAT team members) do a good job; they're very quick and efficient."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Victoria \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were looking for stolen property linked to several crimes in the Victoria area, along with recent home invasion robberies that occurred earlier this week, according to a Victoria \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Department statement issued Friday.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Arrested were:--Damien Zuniga, 17, on suspicion of possession of stolen property, possession of less than 1 gram of a controlled substance and possession of less than 2 ounces of marijuana.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 --Christopher Lee Gutierrez, 33, on suspicion of theft of property worth less than $500, the manufacturing and delivery of less than 200 grams of a controlled substance penalty and three outstanding traffic warrants.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 --Henry Garcia Jr., 17, on suspicion of possession of stolen property.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The suspects are connected to at least five crimes in Victoria, and they could possibly be charged with additional crimes, according to the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  statement.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Detective Tanya Brown, a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  spokeswoman, said \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  took the extra precaution of the armored vehicle and SWAT members because of "the nature of offenses the suspects committed, the violence used during the commission of the offenses (home invasion robberies) and the fact the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suspects\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were believed to be \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 "
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 She said serving the search warrant was considered high-risk with the three suspects.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Brown said she could not say whether the men were connected to a reported theft and non-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 fatal\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shooting in Bloomington.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Lt. Thomas Eisman of the Victoria Sheriff's Office said Friday that he would not comment about the Bloomington incident, which occurred late Wednesday night.

\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  BODY:
\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The counsel for the 50 year old Gregory Afoko, brother of New Patriotic Party's (NPP) National Chairman, Paul Afoko, yesterday argued in court that, the latter's name should be removed from the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Fact Sheet.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to Afoko's Counsel, Ekow Ampah Korsah, his client was a citizen of Ghana with sound mind and of full legal age, who can sue and be sued and, therefore, there was no need for his brother's name to be attached to his. He told the court that, he did not understand why the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  should attach his brother's name, saying there was no need to attach him as a third party. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He further described attaching Paul Afoko's name in the charge sheet as prejudicial which should be removed. This generated heated argument between the prosecution and the defendants for some time. The Prosecutor, Superintendent Francis Baah, also argued that Paul Afoko's name cannot be removed because at that material moment, that was part of the facts they have gathered.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The judge, however, declined the request that Paul Afoko's name should not be in the charge sheet, saying at that moment, the prosecutor has to present the facts as it is.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Meanwhile, the Magistrate court, presided over by Worlanyo Kotoku, refused the bail application submitted by the defend counsel.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Gregory Afoko was remanded into \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  custody to reappear on June 9, 2015, for his alleged role in the assassination of Adam Mahama, the party's Upper East Regional Chairman. He was arraigned before the court at about 11:15 am to face charges of Conspiracy to commit crime and murder yesterday. Meanwhile Asabke Alangdi, the other suspect is currently at large.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Background
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Gregory Afoko was arrested by the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  following the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of Mahama Adams, the late Upper East regional chairman of the NPP. He and one other, Asabke Alangdi, were said to have been named by the deceased as the persons who poured substance believed to be acid on him.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Gregory Afoko appeared at the court premises at about 11:12 am with two \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  holding his arms, whilst still in handcuff. He bowed down to avoid the media from taking pictures of him when walking to the court room and his face was covered after the court.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Both families of Afoko and the late Mahama Adams were present in court, whilst the latter's family were clad in mourning cloths. He has been charged with murder. Adam Mahama was attacked by two persons last Thursday. Gregory Afoko was subsequently arrested in connection with the attack but the other accomplice is on the run.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Facts
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The deceased, Adams Mahama, until his untimely \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was a contractor and the Upper East Regional Chairman of the New Patriotic Party (NPP). First suspect, Gregory Afoko is a farmer, an NPP youth activist and a younger brother to Mr. Paul Afoko, National Chairman of the same party whiles the 2nd suspect, Asabke Alangdi is also a party member.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 During the early part of May, 2015, Mr. Paul Afoko and Kwabena Aygepong, National Chairman and General Secretary respectively of the NPP embarked on a tour. On 14th day of May, 2015, the National Chairman and General Secretary arrived in Bolgatanga. The deceased organized some thugs to violently attack them scuttling the planned meeting at Azumsolom Guest House for campaigning against the flagbearer, Nana Addo Danquah Akuffo Addo and also not notifying him.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The situation was later brought under control by the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  First suspect was not impressed with the action taken by the regional chairman, as a result had serious confrontation with the deceased until he was chased away by the thugs. Later 1st and 2nd suspects mobilized some youth to form another group with their sole aim to protect party executives perceived to be against Nana Akuffo Addo's bid.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The suspects and other members had series of meetings and in the evening of 20th May 2015, two assailants now identified as 1st and 2nd \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suspects\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  with a substance in a gallon suspected to be acid, laid ambush at the deceased residence. The deceased returned home around 11: 00pm in his pick-up vehicle with registration number NR 761-14 immediately he parked the vehicle in front of his, suspects went close, signaled him to roll down the glass. The deceased identified the suspects as party members, rolled down the glass to talk to them.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suddenly, the suspects poured the substance suspected to be acid on his head, face and other parts of his body and fled on a motorbike. The deceased started screaming for help and his wife, Hajia Zenabu Adams, came to the aid of the husband and managed to bring him out of the vehicle. In the process she sustained burns on the right side of the chest and breast.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The wife enquired to know what happened to him and he told her that it was the 1st and 2nd suspects who poured the substance on him. The deceased who could not withstand the pains was still shouting and started removing his clothes. This attracted the attention of the neighbors who took him to the Upper East Regional Hospital. Deceased repeatedly mentioned the names of 1st and 2 suspects as the perpetrators to the neighbors and friends who came to his aid and rushed him to the hospital.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 While the deceased was being prepared to be airlifted to Accra for intensive care, he was pronounced dead. During investigations, the 1st suspect was arrested in his house and when asked to lead to lead \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to the house of the 2nd suspect he rather took them to the father's house.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  later located the house of 2nd suspect who had got wind of their presence and absconded with his wife leaving behind their baby. A gallon which contains some of the substance and a plastic cup were retrieved at the scene for forensic examination. Post mortem examination was conducted on the body of the deceased and the Pathologist gave the cause of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as Shock Lungs and Extensive Acid burns. However, investigation is still ongoing.

\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Met (BBC One), the first episode of a new series about the Metropolitan \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was meant to be a fly-on-the-wall documentary. And yet it was so skilfully constructed that it felt more like a high-end drama, boasting the multistranded structure of acclaimed cop show The Wire and the acutely observed backroom politics of The West Wing.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The first part of the episode introduced us to Andy and Sarah from the force's armed SC&019 unit. The second saw senior \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  planning their media response to the inquest into the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of Mark Duggan, the gang member whose \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  at the hands of a firearms \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  sparked the nationwide riots of August 2011. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 We then saw the aftermath of that inquest, a controversial verdict of "lawful killing", during which tensions between protesters and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  threatened to explode into violence once again. The cameras then moved to a fiery public meeting involving representatives of the black community, before a final thread took us to a potentially combustible street party in Brixton.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This dramatic construction certainly made for good television. There was a tangible sense of trepidation during a raid on a flat belonging to an \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed suspect,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and during the protests following the end of the inquest, when the cameras roamed in and out of a hostile crowd in front of Tottenham \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  station.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 You also felt you were being given valuable insights into the work of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  - not just the undeniably difficult job of the firearms \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  whose splitsecond decisions are held up to intense scrutiny, but also the Met's ongoing struggle to gain the trust of black Londoners, many of whom feel they have been demonised for decades.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The section in which \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  took preemptive action before the Brixton street party - unearthing knives that had been hidden in trees, locking up key gang members on minor charges so they were off the street - could have come straight out of The Wire, which revelled in the canny \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  work of experienced cops in the gangster-ridden housing projects of Baltimore.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But one can't help thinking the person who will be most pleased with this polished product will be Met commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe. Frustrated by years of negative publicity and wary of his force's relationship with journalists following the Leveson inquiry, he has said he decided to open his doors to the BBC so the public could understand what the Met does.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It was a huge risk, but seeing the intense way in which \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  planned their media strategy prior to the Duggan verdict, you can't help feeling that Hogan-Howe knew exactly what he was doing. Each member of the force in that scene was shown to be thoughtful and committed. Would the BBC have been granted access if a certain level of control had not been agreed first?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 How to be Bohemian (BBC Four), an entertaining history of "painters, poets, pioneers and provocateurs", contained characters aplenty. There was French writer G\'e9rard de Nerval who used to walk his pet lobster through the streets of Paris, textile designer William Morris, who lived in a love triangle with his wife Jane and the Pre-Raphaelite painter Rossetti, and, of course, Oscar Wilde, a man who revelled in shocking the middle classes. But the real star of the show was its presenter, Victoria Coren Mitchell who lent the programme (the first of three) the right tone with a combination of witty aper\'e7us and thoughtful commentary.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There is something inherently laughable about the early Bohemians - the friends of Th\'e9ophile Gautier became famous in 19th century Paris for their naked garden parties - and Coren Mitchell was very much alive to this. ("I imagine everyone had a lovely time but nobody wanted to hold the lobster," she said of the garden parties.)
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But Bohemianism was also a deadly serious movement, a challenge to the received wisdoms of the ruling elite, and the source of important art, so the jokes often gave way to sincere editorialising.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "If you live a fully conventional life," Coren Mitchell said at one point, "it's much easier to disapprove of someone who doesn't than to wonder if they are happier than you are."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The other point to make about Coren Mitchell is her enthusiasm. She seemed genuinely thrilled to be talking to the programme's contributors - from the writer Will Self to the painter Maggi Hambling. She even managed a smile during her conversation with the insufferable Rev Richard Coles.

\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 THE ACQUITTAL Saturday of a white Cleveland cop for firing the final blasts of a 137-shot \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  barrage that killed two unarmed blacks ignited instant outrage and protests. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Demonstrators seething over the acquittal of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Michael Brelo, 31, flooded the streets following the verdict - leading to dozens of arrests.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 As darkness cloaked the city, groups of protesters clashed with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in riot gear.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Demonstrators also got into a fight with patrons at a downtown restaurant.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Three people were led away in handcuffs and charged with felony assault and aggravated riot, authorities said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A fourth person was charged with assault after throwing an unknown object through a window and injuring a female patron.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 By early Sunday, cops had arrested roughly 40 people, including a reporter for Northeast Ohio Media Group.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Brelo, 31, was the only one of the 13 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  who opened fire to face criminal charges in the November 2012 incident - and a Cleveland judge found him not guilty in the bench trial.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Prosecutors charged Brelo unloaded 49 shots, including a 15-bullet fusillade while standing on the hood of the car and blasting through the windshield at victims Timothy Russell, 43, and Malissa Williams, 30.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Brelo wept, held his head in his hands and occasionally made the sign of the cross as Judge John O'Donnell found him not guilty.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The shooting followed a 62-car, 100 mph chase that one prosecutor said looked like a clip from the movie "The Blues Brothers." The chase was triggered in downtown Cleveland after cops reacted to what they believed was a gunshot, but was instead Russell's Chevy Malibu backfiring.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 For more than 20 miles, the phalanx of cops chased Russell's 1979 Malibu. The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  unloaded on the vehicle after finally cornering it.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Russell was shot 23 times, and Williams was struck by 24 bullets. Neither \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 victim was armed.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Inside the vehicle, investigators discovered a crack pipe.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Judge John O'Donnell acknowledged that Brelo fired lethal shots at the victims but ruled that the evidence didn't prove his shots caused either \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Russell's family blasted the judge's decision.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Fleeing is not grounds for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 " the family said in a statement. "The exoneration of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Brelo speaks to a complete disregard for the extreme and unnecessary force meted out against some American citizens who happen to be black and brown."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 More than 200 angry but mostly peaceful protesters immediately took to the Cleveland streets, some carrying signs asking, "Will I be next?"
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The demonstrators marched through the city's downtown - at times squaring off with cops.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Three protesters were handcuffed and taken into \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  custody near Quicken Loans Arena.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  held up pepper spray as protesters surged toward those who had been arrested, but tensions quickly cooled.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Racial tensions in Cleveland were already strained by the killing six months ago of Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old black boy shot to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by a rookie white cop. The preteen was carrying a pellet gun.

\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  spokesman Lt. John Crouch said that at about 10 p.m. Friday \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  found the body of a 27-year-old man riddled with what appeared to be bullet wounds near the carport of a home in the 100 block of Albert Street Southwest. Morgan County District Attorney Scott Anderson and Coroner Jeff Chunn also responded to the scene. The victim's identity was being withheld pending notification of family.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 About 9 a.m. Saturday, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  received reports of a dead Hispanic male near Adventure Park, located in Wilson Morgan Park at 300 Beltline Road S.W. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  said he was shot in the head and that the shootings could be related to other violent incidents that occurred overnight Friday. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The identity of the second victim also has not been released.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Chunn said both bodies were taken to Huntsville Forensic Sciences for autopsies. He said he wasn't sure if both \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 deaths\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are related.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We don't have anything directly related, but that is a possibility," Chunn said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Shots were also fired into a home on the 600 block of Fifth Avenue Southwest about 9 p.m. Friday. No one was harmed. The residents said the shots came from a silver Nissan Altima occupied by multiple black males.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  also responded to a robbery at 11:30 p.m. in the 1600 block of Eighth Avenue Southwest.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The victim had her 5-year-old daughter in the back seat of her car when she went inside the home to turn down her daughter's bed, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  said. When she returned to the car to get her daughter, she was approached by two black males who wore all black and ski masks.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The victim said they came out of a light-colored Nissan Altima, and one was \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  with a long, black gun.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 victim\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  said the suspects demanded her money or else they were going to kill her daughter. The victim gave the suspects her purse in response. The suspects left in the Altima, and no one was harmed.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Shots were fired into a home in the 400 block of Fifth Avenue Southwest about 12:30 a.m. Saturday.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The victim in that incident told \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  she was sitting on her couch when she heard multiple gunshots and glass breaking. She took refuge in a bathroom, where she called \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  found multiple bullet holes on the side of the house. A witness to the shooting said she saw a silver Nissan Altima with a black bumper drive away from the house.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A man claiming to be robbed came to the front desk of the Decatur \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Department about 1:15 a.m. He said he was riding his bike near 11th Avenue and Second Street Northwest when two black males dressed in black exited a silver four-door car.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 One was armed with a shotgun, while the other was armed with a handgun. One of the men demanded his belongings, while a third man remained in the car.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The victim said he turned and ran, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  said. He then heard one individual tell another man to shoot him, but no shots were fired, and no one was harmed.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Response
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Anderson said he couldn't release details about the shootings and the slayings because the cases are still being investigated.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Law enforcement is putting every man they can on this," Anderson said. "We need to wait and see what we're dealing with here."
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are asking for any tips that may lead to the suspects' arrests. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are offering a $1,000 reward.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Anyone who might have seen an older model bronze or silver Nissan Altima with a dark colored bumper or a group of black males dressed all in black last night or who might have any other information related to any of these cases is asked to call \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  at 256-476-7638.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Crews resumed recovery efforts yesterday at a remote site in southeast Alaska where a sightseeing plane crashed, killing all nine people aboard. Eight cruise ship passengers and their pilot died when the DeHavilland DHC-3 Otter turboprop went down on Thursday in Misty Fjords National Monument near Ketchikan. The cause of the crash remained under investigation. The identities of those on the plane were being withheld as authorities worked to notify their families. Crews planned to land aircraft near the crash site on an 800-foot cliff above Ella Lake and then hike to the wreckage.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Huge crowds and high rollers in Las Vegas for the Floyd Mayweather-Manny Pacquiao fight helped Nevada casinos make more than $1 billion off gamblers in May, according to records released yesterday. It was the first time casinos exceeded that total in more than a year. "To hit a billion, we're pretty pleased," said Nevada Gaming Control Board analyst Michael Lawton said. Slot machines and tables were packed on fight night, May 2, and casinos responded by raising limits to accommodate big spenders. It was the start of a busy month that included the new Rock in Rio outdoor music festival, the World Series of Poker and Memorial Day weekend.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Walt Disney World is banning selfie sticks from its theme parks, citing safety concerns, a company spokeswoman said yesterday morning. Under a new policy, which takes effect Tuesday, the poles won't make it past the bag check at any Disney World theme park. The sticks also won't be allowed in Disney World water parks or DisneyQuest, a gaming attraction at Downtown Disney. Selfie sticks will also become forbidden at Disneyland Resort in California on Tuesday. The prohibition kicks in at Disney's parks in Paris and Hong Kong on July 1.

\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 AS he reached the white door, ajar at his cousin's home in Durbanville's Fisantekraal, Ivan Ska was met by the horrific sight of the cousin pleading with his hands but unable to utter a word as blood streamed from his head where he'd been shot.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 And on the injured man's chest, lay his two-year-old baby girl, her tiny waist bloodied after one of three gunmen had hit her with a single bullet in her stomach. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Speaking in front of this house of horrors, Skai, 42, said on Saturday evening, he had been making a fire to cook supper when he heard screams nearby.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Someone alerted him that his cousin, Mongezi Gamtele, 35, had been gunned down at home.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He rushed to find the tragic scene of Gamtele taking his last breaths while his daughter, Nosipho Gamtele, 2, clung to life.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I got such a fright when I got to my cousin's house. He was lying in the doorway with his hands in the air but he couldn't speak. His face was full of blood and the child was on his chest also bleeding," recalled Skai.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were then alerted and Gamtele was later declared dead at the scene while the toddler was rushed to Red Cross War Memorial Children's |Hospital.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Hospital spokeswoman Angelique Jordaan said the little girl was recovering after having undergone surgery to remove the bullet lodged in her abdomen.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "She is currently in a stable condition and doing well," she added.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It is alleged that three \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  men had gained access to the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 victim's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  home after posing as \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  dressed in civilian clothing.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 With Gamtele not there at the time, the gunmen had demanded his girlfriend call him to rush home. Upon his arrival, just in front of his shack, the men took his firearm and shot him in the head.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 They then turned a gun on the couple's daughter and shot her in the stomach before they fled the scene.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Skai thinks that his cousin, whom he fondly referred to as Mongi, had been targeted for his licensed firearm and said that it was not the first break-in at Gamtele's house.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The family is all not okay... Mongi didn't drink, he didn't smoke, he just worked and even made videos in his free time," said Skai.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Funeral arrangements will be finalised this weekend.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Gamtele's neighbour Sicelo Smith, 26, said he was shocked by the murder of Gamtele who had been a "friendly man".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said the area had a "very high" crime rate, adding that "even now I'm scared for my safety, we want more \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police".\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are still hunting for the gunmen.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  spokesman Colonel Tembinkosi Kinana confirmed that there were no new developments in the case.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Situated about 5km from Durbanville, the Fisantekraal community is reported to have grown substantially and crime has escalated in the area which has seen "increased unemployment and surrounding business closures".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Durbanville Community Policing Forum (CPF) says it has repeatedly asked for the satellite \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  station serving Fisantekraal to be converted into a fully-fledged station, something the forum says is a "matter of urgency".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The chairwoman of the forum, Lesley Ashton, said cable theft at the satellite station when telephone lines were stolen, hampered communication with the central \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  station which often resulted in slower response times.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Fisantekraal, Ashton added, only had one dedicated \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  vehicle.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Rising crime trends in the area included robberies, assaults, break-ins and armed robberies. In some of the incidents the CPF said "plastic imitation firearms" had been |confiscated.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Ashton said the forum and community were strongly asking the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  authorities and the Department of Community Safety and other roleplayers for another \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  station.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The loss of a father and an injured child due to crime is a very sad way to draw attention once again to the recognised shortfalls in ensuring the safety and security of the greater Durbanville community," she added.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 NEW YORK - Ralph Roberts, a businessman with a gentle demeanor who built Comcast from a small cable TV system in Mississippi into one of the nation's largest entertainment companies, has died. He was 95. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Comcast says in a statement that Mr. Roberts died Thursday night in Philadelphia of natural causes.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr. Roberts jumped into the fledgling cable TV industry in 1963 by spending $500,000 to buy American Cable Systems, a company in Tupelo, Miss. He then acquired other cable systems, changed the name of the company to Comcast and ran the company until he was in his 80s.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He handed control of the company to one of his sons, Brian Roberts, who is now Comcast's chairman and CEO. The younger Mr. Roberts expanded beyond his father's vision and led Comcast to own NBCUniversal.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A graduate of the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, Roberts also served in the U.S. Navy.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He was a well-known philanthropist in Philadelphia, supporting such efforts as Project H.O.M.E., an outreach program for the homeless. HIGH COURT STRIKES DOWN ARIZ. SIGN ORDINANCE
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 WASHINGTON - The Supreme Court on Thursday struck down an Arizona town's ordinance that treated signs directing people to a small church's worship services differently than signs with other messages, such as a political candidate's advertisement.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The decision was unanimous in favor of the tiny Good News Community Church, which has a long-running dispute with the town of Gilbert, Ariz., over signs planted in public rights of way directing congregants to church meeting places.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But the justices split over the correct way to decide the case.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Five justices joined Justice Clarence Thomas's decision that the town's regulations are based on the content of the sign's message and thus require the court's highest First Amendment protection.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The town "singles out specific subject matter for differential treatment, even if it does not target viewpoints within that subject matter," Mr. Thomas wrote. "Ideological messages are given more favorable treatment than messages concerning a political candidate, which are themselves given more favorable treatment than messages announcing an assembly of like-minded individuals."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr. Thomas wrote, "That is a paradigmatic example of content-based discrimination." \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 OFFICER,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  SUSPECT DEAD AFTER SHOOTOUT
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 CINCINNATI - Cincinnati's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  chief says a policeman and an \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed suspect\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  who were shot during a gunfight with other \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have died.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Chief Jeffrey Blackwell says the 27-year \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  veteran died after the shooting this morning in the Madisonville neighborhood. He said the suspect was also killed.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Blackwell said multiple shots were fired between the suspect and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  responding to a 911 call. The chief says he believes the suspect was on the street when \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  arrived.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The shooting comes nine days after Cincinnati \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  released a plan for dealing with a recent surge of gun violence in the city.

\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A HUGE manhunt was under way today after a white gunman opened fire in an African-American church and killed nine people, including a pastor, in a race-hate attack. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The killer burst into the building in Charleston, South Carolina, spraying bullets at his victims as they took part in a Bible study session. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  released the first image of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suspect\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , describing him as \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and dangerous. The massacre took place in Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church last night. Eight victims were killed in the building and the ninth died in hospital. The pastor, state senator Clementa Pinckney, 41, was among the dead. Another person was injured.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to local reports, the gunman let one woman escape so she could tell the story, and a girl of five survived by playing dead.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Detectives said the gunman was white, 21 to 25, slender and about 5ft 9ins tall. He wore a grey top, blue jeans and boots, and fled in a black sedan. City \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  chief Gregory Mullen appealed to the public to help catch him, saying the FBI had joined the hunt.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I do believe it was a hate crime," he added. "This is a tragedy no community should experience, senseless, unfathomable. We are going to do everything in our power to find this individual, to lock him up, to make sure he does not hurt anyone else."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said the scene was chaotic when \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  arrived. They thought a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  dog had tracked the trail of the suspect, but he got away. Dot Scott, president of the Charleston National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said a survivor told her family the gunman sat down in the church before opening fire, and told her he was letting her live so she could tell the world what happened. Family members said a fiveyear-old girl survived after she was told to play dead by her grandmother.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Charleston Mayor Joseph Riley said: "It was a heartbreaking scene. The only reason someone could walk into a church and shoot people praying is hate. It is the most dastardly act that one could possibly imagine." Soon after the attack a bomb threat was made at the building, but the all-clear was given. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  with dogs searched the streets as a helicopter hovered overhead.

\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Two innocent students were killed in a raid by security forces, but Fatoni University in Pattani is intent on ending the cycle of violence
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 'We were building good citizens for a stronger nation, you came and tore them down, said the rector of Fatoni University. We have been left devastated.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 That was the powerful statement made by assistant professor Ismaillutfi Japakiya on April 7, responding to a committee of military men, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and community leaders.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The committee was trying to explain why four innocent young men - including two final year students at Fatoni University - were shot dead in a bungled security raid in Pattani's Thung Yang Daeng district on March 25. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In an attempt to quell outrage among locals, Fourth Army Region commander Lt Gen Prakarn Cholayuth ordered Pattani governor Weerapong Kaewsuwan to appoint a committee to investigate the incident.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The victims of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 fatal\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  village raid, in which 22 were also detained for questioning, had been accused of involvement with the RKK insurgent group.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But the committee found the four dead men had nothing to do with the group, were not militants and were not carrying any weapons at the time of the raid.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr Ismaillutfi broke into tears as he accepted an apology from Lt Gen Prakarn. Even though this does not end today, I am at least glad to know that our children are innocent, he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A CHANCE TO LEARN
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Fatoni University and its rector had always had a fairly low profile within Thailand, although it is well-known in the Islamic world. But since the Thung Yang Daeng tragedy and unprecedented military apology, the university has been thrust into the spotlight.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Fatoni University was known as Yala Islamic University when it was established in 1996. It was originally located on a 43-rai plot in Muang district, Yala province. Construction was funded by the Islamic Development Bank.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr Ismaillutfi founded the university to serve all Muslims in the deep South, with the intention of bringing peace to the area.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The only way to solve the problems here is to introduce education to the area, he told Spectrum.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Before Fatoni was set up, Thai Muslims who wanted to join an Islamic university had to travel to another country, such as Saudi Arabia or Egypt. Mr Ismaillutfi was one such student, and spent 13 years in Saudi Arabia from 1973 to 1986, studying all the way from bachelor's degree level to gaining a doctorate in philosophy.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But he remembers feeling isolated as a student abroad, and said the Thai embassy at the time did little to take care of Thai Muslims in Saudi Arabia.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 They treated me like I was not a Thai citizen, Mr Ismaillutfi said, recalling how he felt neglected by officials.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The experience made him consider the plight of other Thai students in similar situations, and got him thinking about how to improve access to a quality Islamic education closer to home.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Five years after returning to Thailand, Mr Ismaillutfi was invited to a Ministry of Foreign Affairs conference to talk about the issues he faced during his time in Saudi Arabia.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He told the audience that problems in the deep South might be linked to the fact that government officials always treat Thai Muslims like outsiders.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He warned that Thai Muslim students often develop stronger bonds with their host nations than with Thailand, adding that many graduate and come home to work as teachers, but request funding from the country where they studied as opposed to Thai sources.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr Ismaillutfi realised that opening an Islamic university in Thailand could be the answer to many of the problems he wanted to help solve. He started developing a plan to push forward the project, but it wasn't as easy as he had hoped.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 When he first came back from Saudi Arabia, he was monitored by Thai officials.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The continuous pressure started to take its toll, and he almost left the country when officials accused him of being involved with an insurgency group in the deep South.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But his father convinced him to stay where he belonged in Thailand, and to prove security officials wrong by continuing to be an upstanding member of society.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Things gradually improved. Ten years after coming home, he was finally in a position to put his plan into action.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr Ismaillutfi established his university in Yala, integrating Islamic teaching with vocational education so that all students could learn skills to make a living.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The university opened in 1996 but wasn't officially approved until 1998, under the name Yala Islamic College.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The first 200 students were enrolled to learn Islamic Law and Usuluddin, which is a programme of Islamic Studies.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In 2004, the university moved its main campus to a 200-rai plot in Pattani, funded by donors from Saudi Arabia.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The majority of the university's operations are now run from Pattani, while the Yala campus hosts an international programme for foreign students. The university has more than 4,000 Thai and international students.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 CLASH OF FAITHS
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The vast majority of Muslims in Thailand are Sunni, but despite subscribing to the same branch of the religion, people are still divided by differing beliefs.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to a source who asked to remain anonymous, Fatoni University is considered to teach the new path of Islam. The new path is stricter in terms of religious practice and Islamic law, but more liberal and peaceful, the source said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The new path aims to support Muslims to follow the teachings of the Koran, while adopting lessons from the academic world to apply to modern life.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The old path, on the other hand, is more nationalistic. Its approach to the Koran is the same, but those who follow the old path do not see themselves as Thai, but as citizens of Pattani state.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 We don't hate each other, but we believe in different things, said another local source. We always know who follows which path, but it is just a matter of different beliefs.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Those who adhere to the new path believe that knowledge can solve problems and try to access education from mainstream schools and university. But believers in the old path only send their children to Islamic schools, known locally as Pornoh.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 REJECTING BLOODSHED
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 While some use violence to try and get their own way, Mr Ismaillutfi favours a different approach. He sees education as a sustainable means to ending turmoil in the South.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Since I started the university, my slogan has been that we must foster positive lives before careers, Mr Ismaillutfi said. People must understand their life purpose before knowing what they want to do for a living.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 To the rector, that means supporting students to develop high moral values, and helping them consider how their actions affect society as a whole.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr Ismaillutfi has tailored the curriculum at the university to achieving this goal, and his course in Peace Studies is compulsory for all students in order to graduate.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He use lessons in the Koran as a key part of teaching the subject, since Islam advocates peaceful approaches to solving problems, and the world Islam itself means peace.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In addition to his academic work, Mr Ismaillutfi is also co-chairman of the Religions for Peace Inter-Religious Council of Thailand.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He used his experience on the council to help design the Peace Studies curriculum around the concept of peace in all five religions officially recognised in Thailand: Buddhism, Islam, Christianity, Hinduism and Sikhism.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The rector argues that using peace to fight injustice strengthens the case of the oppressed. He said his Peace Studies course doesn't aim to stop people fighting for what they believe in, but teaches them how to fight in a peaceful manner.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 More than 100 years ago the government came into our area and violently abused us, Mr Ismaillutfi said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It didn't solve anything. In fact, it made the situation worse and locals have been trying to fight back using the same violent approach since then.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 AT THE CENTRE OF ASEAN
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Ongoing violence in the deep South means the university is located in a safety red zone. However, foreign students still choose to come and study there.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The number of overseas students has been rising steadily every year. Fatoni now has 200 foreign students enrolled, from 12 countries including Cambodia, China, Myanmar and Laos.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Assistant professor Sukree Langputeh, the deputy rector for academic affairs and research at the university, told Spectrum that schools in China are impressed with the education their students receive in Thailand.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The schools had previously sent their students to study in the Middle East, but when those young people returned to China they seemed a bit rough.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 However, students returning from Thailand exhibit a different attitude. The Chinese schools say they seem friendly, gentle and peaceful - like Muslim people from the south of Thailand.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Another factor that makes Fatoni University popular is that foreign students can learn a range of languages.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 If they study in Saudi Arabia, they can only learn Arabic, but here they can learn Thai, Malay, English and Arabic, Mr Sukree said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The forthcoming Asean Economic Community means that many Muslim students from across Asia, especially the Chinese, see Pattani as a hub for business opportunities with other Asean countries, he added.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 We have taught Chinese entrepreneurs who own businesses in Malaysia, Mr Sukree explained.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 They said coming to study here was great since they could learn the Malay language and be close to Malaysia, which benefits their businesses in the long term.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 After Mr Ismaillutfi addressed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs conference 14 years ago, things started to get better for Thai Muslims who went to study abroad. Officials made more effort to interact with them and helped build networks between isolated students.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 However the rector is convinced that studying at home provides the best option for Thai Muslims. He says students benefit from understanding the national culture and politics, and from developing a sense of civic duty and morality within that context.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr Ismaillutfi now wants all schools in Thailand to start teaching a form of Peace Studies, arguing that peace is the only way to solve violence and political conflicts in all corners of the country.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 My students wouldn't have lost their lives and others will not die in the future if everyone chooses to solve their problems with peace, he said.

\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ONE WEEK before his arrest for a racist rampage at a revered Southern church, Dylann Storm Roof shared an apocalyptic vision of mass murder with a trailer park neighbor.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "He was looking to kill a bunch of people," recalled Christon Scriven, 22, just hours before his bigoted buddy's arrest for a racially motivated killing spree. "He flat out told us he was going to do this stuff. He's just off in the head . . . Weird."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The hate-fueled white gunman was busted Thursday morning after a 14-hour manhunt, suspected in the execution of nine helpless black worshippers inside the historic Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The innocent, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 unarmed victims\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ranged in age from 26 to 87 - and included the venerable church's pastor, an acquaintance of President Obama and First Lady Michelle. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Chilling details emerged about Roof's racist rants inside the church, the ignored pleas of his victims as he reloaded his handgun five times - and his release of one terrified woman to serve as a witness to the carnage.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The shooter said, 'I'm not going to shoot you because I want you to tell everyone what happened,' " Charleston NAACP chapter President Dot Scott told a local newspaper, the Post and Courier.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Roof arrived at 8 p.m. for the Wednesday prayer meeting, bringing a heart filled with evil and a fully loaded handgun, officials said. He spent an hour with his victims before declaring his murderous intent with a merciless four-word announcement: "You have to go."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Sylvia Johnson, a cousin of the slain pastor, the Rev. Clementa Pinckney, told MSNBC that a survivor recounted how Roof delivered one final crazed comment before the shooting started.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I have to do it," he was quoted as saying. "You rape our women and you're taking over our country."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Eight of the victims were found dead inside the house of worship with two centuries of history, while the ninth died in the operating room of a nearby hospital.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Three people survived the bloodshed, although authorities released no details about the fortunate trio.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Roof, 21, a high school dropout and accused drug user, was nabbed after driving 245 miles from the church parking lot to the town of Shelby, N.C. - where a woman recognized his black Hyundai and Three Stooges-style bowl haircut.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "A terrible human being who would go into a place of worship where people are praying and kill them is now in custody - where he will always remain," said Charleston Mayor Joseph Riley.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The mass slaying of the pastor and his flock during an evening Bible study session was immediately labeled a hate crime, even as it echoed sad chapters from America's violent past.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 President Obama invoked the killing of four black girls in a 1963 Birmingham, Ala., church bombing by the Ku Klux Klan. And the shooting spree harkened to mass killings at the Sandy Hook Elementary School, a Colorado movie theater and the carnage at Virginia Tech.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The fact that this took place in a black church obviously . . . raises questions about a dark part of our history," the President declared.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But Obama also took aim at a Congress that has repeatedly rebuffed White House efforts on gun control.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "At some point, we as a country will have to reckon with the fact that this type of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries," he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "And it is in our power to do something about it. I say that, recognizing the politics in this town foreclose a lot of those avenues right now."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Obama noted that he and his wife personally knew some parishioners at the church - including its slain pastor, who was also a South Carolina politician.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In other developments:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * The FBI learned of Roof's identity when childhood friend Joey Meek, 20, recognized his skinny friend's face and grimy gray sweatshirt in a surveillance camera frame grab from the church.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I didn't THINK it was him," Meek said. "I KNEW it was him."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * Roof waived both his right to extradition and his right to counsel at a 10-minute North Carolina hearing, clearing the way for his Thursday night return to South Carolina.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * Cops released Roof's 2015 rap sheet: A Feb. 28 bust for possession of a controlled substance in the local mall and an April 26 arrest for trespassing at the same mall.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * An ominous Facebook photo showed the demented mass murder suspect glaring into the camera while wearing a black jacket decorated with an apartheid-era South African flag.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * Roof's father, Ben, refused to comment, calling the cops on a reporter at his South Carolina home. The suspect's uncle said the dad's 21st birthday present to Roof in April was a .45-caliber handgun.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * The South Carolina state Legislature came under fire when the Confederate flag, a symbol of the Civil War and slavery, flew at full staff above the Statehouse after the racist murders.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * The multiple murder suspect's sister, 27-year-old Amber, is scheduled to get married Sunday.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * None of the GOP presidential hopefuls - Sens. Marco Rubio, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz - linked gun control to the mass killing at the annual Faith & Freedom Coalition's convention.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton said the time for legislation was now. "We have to be honest," she said Thursday. "How many people do we need to see cut down before we act?"
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Charleston County Coroner Rae Wooten read off the sad litany of victims' names, noting all were shot to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  without giving any specifics.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The best known was the well-respected Rev. Pinckney, 41, who served as both pastor and state senator. Pinckney, the father of two girls and a preaching prodigy since age 13, was elected to the Statehouse at 23 - making him the youngest member of the House at the time.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Three other church officials were also killed: Sharonda Coleman-Singleton, 45, Daniel Simmons, 74, and Mira Thompson, 59. Other victims included longtime parishioner Susie Jackson, 87, and one-time church janitor Ethel Lance, 70.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The others killed were identified as public library branch manager Cynthia Hurd, 54; college enrollment counselor DePayne Doctor, 49; and recent college graduate Tywanza Sanders, 26.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Roof's appearance at the church meeting did not alarm any of the worshippers, who are used to drop-ins from tourists visiting the historical building.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Authorities said the arrest of the suspect came without incident at 10:49 a.m. after a local citizen called \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to report she had spied Roof in his getaway car.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Roof, roughly 25 minutes after he was stopped by cops, surrendered quietly. Charleston \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Chief Greg Mullen characterized the killer as "cooperative" as he was taken into custody by local \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers. Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  said the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suspect\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was still \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  when approached by cops. Authorities believe Roof acted alone in planning and executing the lethal attack.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A woman on her way to work at a Shelby florist recognized Roof's black Hyundai on Highway 74 and called her boss - who in turn dialed the cops.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I knew it was a black car . . . I saw pictures of him with the bowl cut," a teary Debbie Dills told the Shelby Star newspaper.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Roof was fitted by cops with a bulletproof vest and shackles on his hands and feet before he was taken from the local \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  station to court.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Roof's trailer park pal Scriven, who is black, said the suspected shooter initially plotted to target the College of Charleston and not the church.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "You don't know when to take him seriously and when not to," said Scriven. "To be honest, I didn't react (to the news). I was like, 'Awww man, he did that s---.' "
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said his niece Emily was once in the same eighth-grade class as Roof - described by the GOP presidential hopeful as "one of these whacked out kids."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Graham, after speaking with his sister Darline Nordone and his niece, told CNN that his relatives had nothing positive to say about Roof.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "He was quiet, strange, very anti-social and everyone thought he was on drugs," said Graham. ". . . It's about a young man who is obviously twisted."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Roof could face the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  penalty under South Carolina law or federal hate crime statutes if the case goes that route.

\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  An antiterrorism court on Friday remanded Muttahida Qaumi Movement leader Amir Khan in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  custody for a week in a case pertaining to instigating terrorism and harbouring criminals.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The MQM leader was picked up along with dozens of other suspects by the Rangers in a pre-dawn raid on and around the party headquarters Nine Zero in Azizabad some three months ago.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 While placing them under 90-day preventive detention, the paramilitary force had informed a court that they had credible information about their alleged involvement in offences related to targeted killing and terrorism. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 On June 4, the Rangers handed over the MQM leader to the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  after registering a case against him and others for allegedly harbouring criminals and using them for terrorist activities.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Amid tight security arrangements, the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  on Friday produced Amir Khan before the ATC and the investigating \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  sought his custody for two weeks for questioning.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 However, the judge of the ATC-II handed over the MQM leader to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  on physical remand for one week and asked the investigating \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to produce him at the next hearing along with a progress report.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui and other party leaders were also present in the court during the hearing, while dozens of female activists of the MQM staged a protest demonstration outside the court.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to the FIR, the Rangers during the March 11 raid had arrested 26 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed suspects\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  including Faisal Mehmood alias Mota, who was sentenced to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by a court in absentia for the murder of journalist Wali Khan Babar; Obaid alias K2, who was wanted in many cases; and Noman alias Nomi, an absconder in the Advocate Niamat Ali Randhawa murder case.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Besides, 59 others suspects, including Amir Khan, had also been arrested during the raid and placed under preventive detention, the FIR added.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It alleged that the MQM leader and others admitted during questioning that Amir Khan was in charge of the party headquarters security and he along with Minhaj Qazi, Raees Mama, Shahzad Mullah, Imran Ijaz Niazi and Naeem alias Mullah had allegedly provided shelter to arrested criminals and had been using them for terrorist activities.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A joint investigation team (JIT) recommended the registration of a case against the MQM leader and others, it concluded.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The case was registered against Amir Khan and others under Sections 11V (directing terrorist activities), 21J (harbouring any person who committed an offence under this act) and 7 (punishment for act of terrorism) of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 on a complaint of Deputy Superintendent Rangers Ashraf Hussain at the Azizabad \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  station.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The offences in question carry life imprisonment and confiscation of assets.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 After the hearing, MQM leader Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui said they were being politically victimised. He said his party had faced similar accusations in the past also. He added that the party was being pushed to the wall and Amir Khan was falsely implicated in the case as the suspects had not been declared criminals yet by courts.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Meanwhile, the paramilitary force submitted release orders of 38 suspects, including former MQM lawmaker Yusuf Munir Sheikh, to the ATC after they had been found guiltless during interrogation, it emerged on Friday.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The 38 suspects, who had been taken into custody during the March 11 raid, were released during the current and past weeks.

\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A SKYDIVER narrowly cheated \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  after her parachute failed through suspected sabotage.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The 39-year-old woman triggered her main parachute at 4,000 ft but it did not open up. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 She survived only because her reserve chute deployed just in time to stop her smashing into the ground below.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have now arrested a man following the terrifying incident at a military airfield in Wiltshire. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  said it was a miracle she did not die.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Concerned fellow skydivers had alerted detectives to their suspicions that the woman's parachute had been tampered with. And \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  found evidence that 'slinks' - connectors that join the parachute's canopy to its harness - had been deliberately removed.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The incident unfolded when the experienced skydiver was carrying out a routine jump at Netheravon Airfield on Salisbury Plain on April 5. The woman, from Amesbury in Wiltshire, was taken to Southampton hospital with 'multiple serious injuries', including broken ribs and legs. She is recovering at home.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Wiltshire \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have questioned many members of the parachute club but want any other witnesses to the incident to come forward.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 'This woman would have been dead if her chute hadn't partially opened,' said Detective Inspector Paul Franklin.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 'This meant her descent was slowed enough for her to survive the fall. However, we were alerted to concerns over what had happened by the parachute club and as a result instigated an investigation. In particular, we are looking for slinks that were missing from the parachute which may have been removed and discarded.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 'This woman survived this fall miraculously but, despite her experience, she very nearly lost her life.' Detectives took a 35-year-old man into custody for questioning on suspicion of attempted murder. He was later released on bail. Netheravon, which was used by the military during both world wars, is one of the oldest airfields anywhere, having been established in 1912.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It is now home to the Army Parachute Association, a club set up by a former SAS commander that organises skydives for military personnel, veterans and civilians.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A spokesman for South Western Ambulance Service said: 'It was a bad landing. She was a female in her 30s.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 'It was queried on scene that it was a spinal injury.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 'We sent one paramedic in a rapid response vehicle, one crew and land ambulance and South Central's air ambulance. She was taken to hospital in the air ambulance.' It is not the first time that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have investigated whether a parachute failure was caused deliberately.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Detectives initially treated the skydiving \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of Army cadet Stephen Hilder, 20, as murder. Two of Mr Hilder's friends were arrested over the tragedy at Hibaldstow airfield in Lincolnshire in 2003.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But they were later cleared when \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  came to suspect it was a suicide after finding fibres from the parachute straps on scissors in the boot of his car.

\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 4,000FT PLUNGE MAY HAVE BEEN SABOTAGED
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 BY SAM MARSDEN AND BEN WILKINSON
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 a SKYDIVER narrowly cheated \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  after her parachute failed through suspected sabotage.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The 39-year-old woman triggered her main parachute at 4,000 ft but it did not open up. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 She survived only because her reserve chute deployed just in time to stop her smashing into the ground below.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have now arrested a man following the terrifying incident at a military airfield in Wiltshire. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  said it was a miracle she did not die.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Concerned fellow skydivers had alerted detectives to their suspicions that the woman's parachute had been tampered with. And \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  found evidence that slinks' - connectors that join the parachute's canopy to its harness - had been deliberately removed.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The incident unfolded when the experienced skydiver was carrying out a routine jump at Netheravon Airfield on Salisbury Plain on April 5.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The woman, from Amesbury in Wiltshire, was taken to Southampton hospital with multiple serious injuries', including broken ribs and legs. She is recovering at home.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Wiltshire \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have questioned many members of the parachute club but want any other witnesses to the incident to come forward.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This woman would have been dead if her chute hadn't partially opened,' said Detective Inspector Paul Franklin.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This meant her descent was slowed enough for her to survive the fall.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 However, we were alerted to concerns over what had happened by the parachute club and as a result instigated an investigation. In particular, we are looking for slinks that were missing from the parachute which may have been removed and discarded.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This woman survived this fall miraculously but, despite her experience, she very nearly lost her life.' Detectives took a 35-year-old man into custody for questioning on suspicion of attempted murder. He was later released on bail. Netheravon, which was used by the military during both world wars, is one of the oldest airfields anywhere, having been established in 1912.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It is now home to the Army Parachute Association, a club set up by a former SAS commander that organises skydives for military personnel, veterans and civilians.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A spokesman for South Western Ambulance Service said: It was a bad landing. She was a female in her 30s.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It was queried on scene that it was a spinal injury.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 We sent one paramedic in a rapid response vehicle, one crew and land ambulance and South Central's air ambulance. She was taken to hospital in the air ambulance.'
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It is not the first time that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have investigated whether a parachute failure was caused deliberately.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Detectives initially treated the skydiving \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of Army cadet Stephen Hilder, 20, as murder. Two of Mr Hilder's friends were arrested over the tragedy at Hibaldstow airfield in Lincolnshire in 2003.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But they were later cleared when \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  came to suspect it was a suicide after finding fibres from the parachute straps on scissors in the boot of his car.

\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  BODY:
\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 I am so sick and tired of hearing about Montessori children. Please, give me a break.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Most \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  I believe are good \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and maybe 1 percent or less are bad \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . I think with the way the media treats \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  that if I were one, I would want to quit.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 I also get phone calls from my name and number. It's from a credit card company wanting to lower my interest. I just hang up. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Republican Party should just change their name to the Koch Brothers Party.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Why can't we get the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to come and arrest drug dealers?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The owners of the restaurants in Charleston should buy generators.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 If cursive is taught in the third grade, why do we still have a class of 13 and 14 year olds that can neither read nor write cursive?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 I applaud the County Commissioners for going after the PSC and the rate hikes on these utilities. I just wish it had happened several years ago when the water and electric companies kept getting raise after raise every year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Does a foster child who is adopted have a social worker or someone to watch over the parents and the wellness of the child? This is very important information that I need.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It's my understanding that cursive writing is not taught in school now in any grade.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It is extremely poor planning to block the Southside Bridge ramp two days in a row. The cops there do not know how to direct traffic.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 As far as food trucks parking in front of restaurants goes, that needs to be stopped. The restaurants have a real investment in the city of Charleston and pay property taxes, business taxes and so forth. The food trucks may pay business taxes, but that's about it. All they're doing is using the established business as their draw and then stealing their business. That needs to be stopped.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 If the United States was made up of organs like the human body West Virginia would be the large intestine. Full of wastes and getting out is the only option for relief.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Can the Gazette inform the public as to the status of the penalty given those rioters and looters in Baltimore? If any?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 When they determine who aided in the escape of the two convicted murderers from the New York prison, give them the same sentence as the two escapees. If there is any loss of life from this escape, then the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  penalty should be considered.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Charleston City Ordinance Section 114-706 clearly states: "No person shall ride any bicycle upon any sidewalk within the city except where, by ordinance, the council of the city has designated such sidewalk as an official bicycle route and has marked such sidewalk with appropriate signs to that effect." Why will the Charleston \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  not enforce this ordinance?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Which genius legislators thought it'd be a good idea to rob me of my right to know who's carrying a concealed weapon in my vicinity? As usual, this is a law the consequences of which fall most heavily on women. If a deranged stalker has already violated a restraining order, it would seem important for the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 victim\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to know he's now \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  wouldn't you think?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The person complaining about Mountain Justice camping at Kanawha State Forest will be glad to know that they paid full price for the shelters for the entire week, providing much needed revenue to support the Forest.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 If the Legislature requires all Welfare recipients to take drug tests in order to receive benefits then I think the Legislature should be required to pass IQ tests in order to write such legislation. Fair is fair!
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Sure would appreciate some repair to the St. Albans stop lights. Sitting waaaaay too long for light changes!!!
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 West Virginia's DOH, if the department is out of finances, they should look at themselves as a business. Things to look for: too many roads (need to decommission some), too many unneeded supervisor's (higher paychecks). This would give some wasted money to cut grass, fix potholes and maybe pave some roads.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 If anyone in Winfield other than the elected officials has requested a new city hall, as the mayor claims is one reason to annex 200 acres that conveniently has 30 plus businesses (more b&o taxes), please publish your names in the paper so all can see. Hurricane and now Winfield have to have the most greedy scum of all WV towns. Oops, forgot about Dollar Danny of Charleston.

\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  BODY:
\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In recent times, there has been a rising wave of crime rates, especially in Lagos, which has continued to put residents and visitors to the megacity in palpable fear of being \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 victims\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of attacks from hoodlums and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  bandits.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Burdened with the enormous challenge of curtailing the rising crime rate in the state, the state \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Command, has advised Governor Akinwunmi Ambode to provide combat-ready helicopters for its men and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to mount surveillance across the state.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The rising crime rate in the state, hit the head, last Friday, following the murder of one Sodiq in the Mushin area of the state. Sodiq, it was said, was murdered in cold blood by unknown gunmen, around 2pm, shortly after Jumaat service. The killings in the area which was becoming a recurring decimal irked residents, who protested at the Lagos State House of Assembly, to register their displeasure. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Speaking on behalf of the aggrieved residents, Mr. Abiodun Leshi, explained that the affected streets that have lost sleep in recent times were Taniolodo, Lawani and Ojelawe.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In a related development, there is a fresh battle by Lagos State Government to tackle the resurgence of motorcycle operators popularly called Okada riders in all the 475 restricted roads including bridges and highways in the state. Recall that the last administration of Babatunde Fashola, in 2012, signed the Lagos Road Traffic Bill into law, restricting operations of okada riders from specific roads in the state.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 At onset, there was high compliance by the riders, but towards the 2015 general elections, there was an explosion in the resurgence of riders across the state, even on restricted routes. Angered that the riders apparently took advantage of election period to flout the law, the state government last weekend, issued a 48-hour ultimatum to the recalcitrant okada riders, not to ply the 475 restricted roads, including bridges and highways. It warned that failure to adhere to the law, both the rider and the passengers, will be prosecuted by a Special Taskforce it has set-up.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Meanwhile, on the increasing crime rate in the state, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police officers,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  particularly Divisional \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police Officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and Area Commanders, who spoke during an interactive session with Ambode, last week, at the Oduduwa \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Command in Ikeja, lamented that the perennial traffic gridlocks in the metropolis was affecting prompt arrival of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  at crime scenes, adding that the situation calls for the need of aerial patrol across the state to stem the tide.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Other complaints tabled before the governor was that the helicopters procured by the last administration were not fully equipped to combat-ready standard, that the daily increase in the state population required the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to adopt more surveillance strategies, that the number of patrol vehicles were not enough to enforce the 2012 road traffic law.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Responding, Ambode said "When we had our security council meeting, this was one of the issues raised at the meeting. We know that the helicopters we have at the moment are not combat ready. So we are looking for helicopters that can perform multi-task that is an helicopter that can patrol the state during the day and at night.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We want to make sure that we keep the state safe always. Whatever strategy it would require for us to have a safe society, this administration will do it to ensure that lives and property are well protected. The final solution is that we must have an integrated security plan in the state that would ensure that we are safe in the air, on land and water. All these will be integrated together using the Nigerian \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 "
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The governor noted that vehicles would be provided to patrol the state and adequate fuel would be supplied to ensure movement of the vehicles, adding that his administration would reactivate the fuel collection point and ensure that adequate fuel is provided weekly.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 However, Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Transportation, Mr. Oluseyi Coker, who stressed that the Traffic Law (Schedule 11) which restricts the operations of motorcycle as well as Regulation 16 Sub-sections 4, 5 and 6 of the Law are sacrosanct said: "Section 3 Sub-section 1 of the Law stipulates that "No person shall ride, drive or propel a cart, wheel barrow, motorcycle or tricycle on any of the routes specified in Schedule 11 to this Law.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "However, it is disheartening to see that motorcycle operators have resurfaced on our restricted roads especially in areas such as Ikeja, Isolo, Apapa, Agege, Epe, Ijede, Shomolu/ Bariga, Ifako Ijaiye/ Ojokoro, Ikorodu, Mushin, Ketu, Ojota, Lagos Island, Ojodu and Badagry, in spite of the various efforts of the past administrations in the State to ensure that the menace of motorcycle operators is curbed and the rate of accident, injuries and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is reduced drastically in the state."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The present administration of Ambode would not fold its arms and allow lawlessness, indiscipline, flagrant disobedience to law and order, loss of lives and property of innocent citizens of the state to continue unabated," he said.

\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  BODY:
\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ONE WEEK before his arrest for a racist rampage at a revered Southern church, Dylann Storm Roof shared an apocalyptic vision of mass murder with a trailer park neighbor.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "He was looking to kill a bunch of people," recalled Christon Scriven, 22, just hours before his bigoted buddy's arrest for a racially motivated killing spree. "He flat out told us he was going to do this stuff. He's just off in the head . . . Weird."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The hate-fueled white gunman was busted Thursday morning after a 14-hour manhunt, suspected in the execution of nine helpless black worshippers inside the historic Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The innocent, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 unarmed victims\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ranged in age from 26 to 87 - and included the venerable church's pastor, an acquaintance of President Obama and First Lady Michelle. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Chilling details emerged about Roof's racist rants inside the church, the ignored pleas of his victims as he reloaded his handgun five times - and his release of one terrified woman to serve as a witness to the carnage.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The shooter said, 'I'm not going to shoot you because I want you to tell everyone what happened,' " Charleston NAACP chapter President Dot Scott told a local newspaper, the Post and Courier.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Roof arrived at 8 p.m. for the Wednesday prayer meeting, bringing a heart filled with evil and a fully loaded handgun, officials said. He spent an hour with his victims before declaring his murderous intent with a merciless four-word announcement: "You have to go." Sylvia Johnson, a cousin of the slain pastor, the Rev. Clementa Pinckney, told MSNBC that a survivor recounted how Roof delivered one final crazed comment before the shooting started.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I have to do it," he was quoted as saying. "You rape our women and you're taking over our country."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Eight of the victims were found dead inside the house of worship with two centuries of history, while the ninth died in the operating room of a nearby hospital.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Three people survived the bloodshed, although authorities released no details about the fortunate trio.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Roof, 21, a high school dropout and accused drug user, was nabbed after driving 245 miles from the church parking lot to the town of Shelby, N.C. - where a woman recognized his black Hyundai and Three Stooges-style bowl haircut.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "A terrible human being who would go into a place of worship where people are praying and kill them is now in custody - where he will always remain," said Charleston Mayor Joseph Riley.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The mass slaying of the pastor and his flock during an evening Bible study session was immediately labeled a hate crime, even as it echoed sad chapters from America's violent past.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 President Obama invoked the killing of four black girls in a 1963 Birmingham, Ala., church bombing by the Ku Klux Klan. And the shooting spree harkened to mass killings at the Sandy Hook Elementary School, a Colorado movie theater and the carnage at Virginia Tech.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The fact that this took place in a black church obviously . . . raises questions about a dark part of our history," the President declared. But he also took aim at a Congress that has repeatedly rebuffed White House efforts on gun control.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "At some point, we as a country will have to reckon with the fact that this type of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries," he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "And it is in our power to do something about it. I say that, recognizing the politics in this town foreclose a lot of those avenues right now."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Obama noted that he and his wife personally knew some parishioners at the church - including its slain pastor, who was also a South Carolina politician.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In other developments:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 l The FBI learned of Roof's identity when childhood friend Joey Meek, 20, recognized his skinny friend's face and grimy gray sweatshirt in a surveillance camera frame grab from the church.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I didn't THINK it was him," Meek said. "I KNEW it was him."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * Roof waived both his right to extradition and his right to counsel at a 10-minute North Carolina hearing, clearing the way for his Thursday night return to South Carolina.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * Cops released Roof's 2015 rap sheet: A Feb. 28 bust for possession of a controlled substance in the local mall and an April 26 arrest for trespassing at the same mall.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * An ominous Facebook photo showed the demented mass murder suspect glaring into the camera while wearing a black jacket decorated with an apartheid-era South African flag.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * Roof's father, Ben, refused to comment, calling the cops on a reporter at his South Carolina home. The suspect's uncle said the dad's 21st birthday present to Roof in April was a .45-caliber handgun.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * The South Carolina state Legislature came under fire when the Confederate flag, a symbol of the Civil War and slavery, flew at full staff above the Statehouse after the racist murders.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * The multiple murder suspect's sister, 27-year-old Amber, is scheduled to get married Sunday.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * None of the GOP presidential hopefuls - Sens. Marco Rubio, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz - linked gun control to the mass killing at the annual Faith & Freedom Coalition's convention.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton said the time for legislation was now. "We have to be honest," she said Thursday. "How many people do we need to see cut down before we act?"
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Charleston County Coroner Rae Wooten read off the sad litany of victims' names, noting all were shot to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  without giving any specifics.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The best known was the well-respected Rev. Pinckney, 41, who served as both pastor and state senator. Pinckney, the father of two girls and a preaching prodigy since age 13, was elected to the Statehouse at 23 - making him the youngest member of the House at the time.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Three other church officials were also killed: Sharonda Coleman-Singleton, 45; Daniel Simmons, 74; and Mira Thompson, 59. Other victims included longtime parishioner Susie Jackson, 87, and one-time church janitor Ethel Lance, 70.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The others killed were identified as public library branch manager Cynthia Hurd, 54; college enrollment counselor DePayne Doctor, 49; and recent college graduate Tywanza Sanders, 26.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Roof's appearance at the church meeting did not alarm any of the worshipers, who are used to drop-ins from tourists visiting the historical building.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Authorities said the arrest of the suspect came without incident at 10:49 a.m. after a local citizen spied Roof in his getaway car.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Roof, roughly 25 minutes after he was stopped by cops, surrendered quietly. Charleston \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Chief Greg Mullen characterized the killer as "cooperative" as he was taken into custody by local \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers. Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  said the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suspect\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was still \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  when approached by cops. Authorities believe Roof acted alone in planning and executing the lethal attack.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The eagle-eyed citizen, a woman on her way to work at a Shelby florist, recognized Roof's black Hyundai on Highway 74 and called her boss - who dialed cops.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I knew it was a black car . . . I saw pictures of him with the bowl cut," a teary Debbie Dills told the Shelby Star newspaper after spotting the alleged murderer. Roof was fitted by cops with a bulletproof vest and shackles on his hands and feet before he was taken from the local \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  station to court.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Roof's trailer park pal Scriven, who is black, said the suspected shooter initially plotted to target the College of Charleston and not the church.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "You don't know when to take him seriously and when not to," said Scriven. "To be honest, I didn't react (to the news). I was like, 'Awww man, he did that s---.' "
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said his niece Emily was once in the same eighth-grade class as Roof - described by the GOP presidential hopeful as "one of these whacked out kids."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Graham, after speaking with his sister Darline Nordone and his niece, told CNN that his relatives had nothing positive to say about Roof.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "He was quiet, strange, very anti-social and everyone thought he was on drugs," said Graham. "It's about a young man who is obviously twisted."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Roof could face the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  penalty under South Carolina law or federal hate crime statutes if the case goes that route.

\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  BODY:
\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ONE WEEK before his arrest for a racist rampage at a revered Southern church, Dylann Storm Roof shared an apocalyptic vision of mass murder with a trailer park neighbor.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "He was looking to kill a bunch of people," recalled Christon Scriven, 22, just hours before his bigoted buddy's arrest for a racially motivated killing spree. "He flat out told us he was going to do this stuff. He's just off in the head . . . Weird."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The hate-fueled white gunman was busted Thursday morning after a 14-hour manhunt, suspected in the execution of nine helpless black worshippers inside the historic Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The innocent, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 unarmed victims\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ranged in age from 26 to 87 - and included the venerable church's pastor, an acquaintance of President Obama and First Lady Michelle. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Chilling details emerged about Roof's racist rants inside the church, the ignored pleas of his victims as he reloaded his handgun five times - and his release of one terrified woman to serve as a witness to the carnage.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The shooter said, 'I'm not going to shoot you because I want you to tell everyone what happened,' " Charleston NAACP chapter President Dot Scott told a local newspaper - the Post and Courier - the survivor said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Roof arrived at 8 p.m. for the Wednesday prayer meeting, bringing a heart filled with evil and a fully loaded handgun, officials said. He spent an hour with his victims before declaring his murderous intent with a merciless four-word announcement: "You have to go." Sylvia Johnson, a cousin of the slain pastor, the Rev. Clementa Pinckney, told MSNBC that a survivor recounted how Roof delivered one final crazed comment before the shooting started.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I have to do it," he was quoted as saying. "You rape our women and you're taking over our country."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Eight of the victims were found dead inside the house of worship with two centuries of history, while the ninth died in the operating room of a nearby hospital. Three people survived the bloodshed.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Roof, 21, a high school dropout and accused drug user, was nabbed after driving 245 miles from the church parking lot to the town of Shelby, N.C. - where a woman recognized his black Hyundai and Three Stooges-style bowl haircut.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "A terrible human being who would go into a place of worship where people are praying and kill them is now in custody - where he will always remain," said Charleston Mayor Joseph Riley.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The mass slaying of the pastor and his flock during an evening Bible study session was immediately labeled a hate crime, even as it echoed sad chapters from America's violent past.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 President Obama invoked the killing of four black girls in a 1963 Birmingham, Ala., church bombing by the Ku Klux Klan. And the shooting spree harkened to mass killings at the Sandy Hook Elementary School, a Colorado movie theater and the carnage at Virginia Tech.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The fact that this took place in a black church obviously . . . raises questions about a dark part of our history," the President declared. But he also took aim at a Congress that has repeatedly rebuffed White House efforts on gun control.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "At some point, we as a country will have to reckon with the fact that this type of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries," he said. "And it is in our power to do something about it. I say that, recognizing the politics in this town foreclose a lot of those avenues right now."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Obama noted that he and his wife personally knew some parishioners at the church - including its slain pastor, who was also a South Carolina politician.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In other developments:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * The FBI learned of Roof's identity when childhood friend Joey Meek, 20, recognized his skinny friend's face and grimy gray sweatshirt in a surveillance camera frame grab from the church.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I didn't THINK it was him," Meek said. "I KNEW it was him."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * Roof waived both his right to extradition and his right to counsel and was being held pending a bond hearing in South Carolina Thursday night.l Cops released Roof's 2015 rap sheet: A Feb. 28 bust for possession of a controlled substance in the local mall and an April 26 arrest for trespassing at the same mall.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * An ominous Facebook photo showed the demented mass murder suspect glaring into the camera while wearing a black jacket decorated with an apartheid-era South African flag.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * Roof's father, Ben, refused to comment, calling the cops on a reporter at his South Carolina home. The suspect's uncle said the dad's 21st birthday present to Roof in April was a .45-caliber handgun.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * The South Carolina state Legislature came under fire when the Confederate flag, a symbol of the Civil War and slavery, flew at full staff above the Statehouse after the racist murders.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * The multiple murder suspect's sister, 27-year-old Amber, is scheduled to get married Sunday.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * None of the GOP presidential hopefuls - Sens. Marco Rubio, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz - linked gun control to the mass killing at the annual Faith & Freedom Coalition's convention.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton said the time for legislation was now. "We have to be honest," she said Thursday. "How many people do we need to see cut down before we act?"
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Charleston County Coroner Rae Wooten read off the sad litany of victims' names, noting all were shot to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The best known was the well-respected Rev. Pinckney, 41, who served as both pastor and state senator. Pinckney, the father of two girls and a preaching prodigy since age 13, was elected to the Statehouse at 23 - making him the youngest member of the House at the time.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Three other church officials were also killed: Sharonda Coleman-Singleton, 45; Rev. Daniel Simmons, 74; and Myra Thompson, 59. Other victims included longtime parishioner Susie Jackson, 87, and one-time church janitor Ethel Lance, 70.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The others killed were identified as public library branch manager Cynthia Hurd, 54; college enrollment counselor DePayne Middleton-Doctor, 49; and recent college grad Tywanza Sanders, 26.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Jackson's niece, Cynthia Taylor, said she had spoken to a survivor, Felecia Sanders, who said she had played dead as she lay on top of her granddaughter to protect them both during the carnage.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Roof's appearance at the church meeting did not alarm any of the worshipers, who are used to drop-ins from tourists visiting the historical building.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Authorities said the arrest of the suspect came without incident at 10:49 a.m. after a local citizen spied Roof in his getaway car.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Roof, roughly 25 minutes after he was stopped by cops, surrendered quietly. Charleston \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Chief Greg Mullen characterized the killer as "cooperative" as he was taken into custody by local \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers. Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  said the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suspect\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was still \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  when approached by cops. Authorities believe Roof acted alone in planning and executing the lethal attack.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The eagle-eyed citizen, a woman on her way to work at a Shelby florist, recognized Roof's black Hyundai on Highway 74 and called her boss - who dialed cops.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I knew it was a black car . . . I saw pictures of him with the bowl cut," a teary Debbie Dills told the Shelby Star newspaper after spotting the alleged murderer. Roof was fitted by cops with a bulletproof vest and shackles on his hands and feet before he was taken from the local \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  station to court.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Roof's trailer park pal Scriven, who is black, said the suspected shooter initially plotted to target the College of Charleston and not the church.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "You don't know when to take him seriously and when not to," said Scriven. "To be honest, I didn't react (to the news). I was like, 'Awww man, he did that s---.' "
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said his niece Emily was once in the same eighth-grade class as Roof - described by the GOP presidential hopeful as "one of these whacked out kids."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Graham, after speaking with his sister Darline Nordone and his niece, told CNN that his relatives had nothing positive to say about Roof.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "He was quiet, strange, very anti-social and everyone thought he was on drugs," said Graham. "It's about a young man who is obviously twisted."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Roof could face the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  penalty under South Carolina law or federal hate crime statutes if the case goes that route.

\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  An antiterrorism court issued on Thursday a notice to a prosecutor on a bail application of Muttahida Qaumi Movement leader Aamir Khan in a case pertaining to instigating terrorism and harbouring criminals. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Pakistan Rangers had detained the MQM leader with dozens of other suspects for three-month preventive detention after their arrest during a raid in and around the party headquarters, Nine Zero, in Azizabad on March 11 and recently booked him for allegedly providing shelter to criminals and using them for terrorist activities.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Aamir Khan through his counsel moved a bail application and the judge of ATC-II issued a notice to a special public prosecutor on the application for Friday.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Copies of the prosecution's documents were also provided to the suspect, a mandatory procedure before indictment, as required under Section 265-C (supply of statements and documents to accused) of the criminal procedure code.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The prosecution said that the paramilitary force had also arrested 26 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed suspects\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , including Faisal Mehmood alias Mota, who had been sentenced to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by a court in absentia for the murder of journalist Wali Khan Babar, and other wanted and absconding suspects during the March 11 raid.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It further said that the MQM leader was in charge of the party headquarters security and he with five others had allegedly provided shelter to arrested criminals and had been using them for terrorist activities in the city.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 An antiterrorism court extended on Thursday the physical remand of a suspect in a double murder case till July 5.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Umair Hassan Siddiqui, said to be a worker of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement, has been booked for allegedly killing two tea vendors Niaz Gul and Iqbal Hussain in Gulshan-e-Maymar in April 2013.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 After the end of his first remand, the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  again produced the suspect in court. Special public prosecutor of the Rangers Rana Khalid submitted that the suspect was placed under 90-day preventive detention by the paramilitary force in March and he confessed before a joint investigation team to his alleged involvement in dozens of cases of targeted killing.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The prosecutor sought extension in the physical remand of the suspect for further questioning and arrest of his accomplices.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Defence lawyer Latif Pasha, who is also a member of the MQM legal aid committee, opposed the extension in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  custody and contended that the allegations were baseless as the prosecution could not bring out any incriminating evidence against the suspect despite keeping him in detention for three months.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The judge of the ATC-II granted a 10-day extension in the physical remand of the suspect and asked the investigating \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to produce him in court with a progress report on the next hearing.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Meanwhile, another ATC remanded on Thursday the same suspect in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  custody for two weeks in a case pertaining to the murder of a paramilitary soldier.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The suspect was accused of killing Rangers personnel Shaukat near the Suparco office within the jurisdiction of the Mobina Town \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  station in 2010.

\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 THE ACQUITTAL Saturday of a white Cleveland cop for firing the final blasts of a 137-shot \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  barrage that killed two unarmed blacks ignited outrage and protests.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Police Officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Michael Brelo, 31, was the only one of the 13 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  who opened fire in November 2012 to face criminal charges - and a Cleveland judge found him not guilty in the bench trial. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Prosecutors charged Brelo unloaded 49 shots, including a 15-bullet fusillade while standing on the hood of the car and blasting through the windshield at victims Timothy Russell, 43, and Malissa Williams, 30.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Brelo wept, held his head in his hands and occasionally made the sign of the cross as Judge John O'Donnell found him not guilty.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The shooting followed a 62-car, 100 mph chase that one prosecutor said looked like a clip from the movie "The Blues Brothers." The chase was triggered in downtown Cleveland after cops reacted to what they believed was a gunshot, but was instead Russell's Chevy Malibu backfiring.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Russell was shot 23 times, and Williams was struck by 24 bullets.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Neither \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 victim was armed.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  More than 200 angry but peaceful protesters immediately took to the Cleveland streets, some carrying signs asking, "Will I be next?"
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Racial tensions in Cleveland were already strained by the killing six months ago of Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old black boy shot to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by a rookie white cop. The pre-teen was carrying a pellet gun.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "This verdict is another chilling reminder of a broken relationship between the Cleveland \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  department and the community it serves," said U.S. Rep. Marcia Fudge.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Cleveland community activist Carole Steiner agreed: "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  murder people of color and not have to serve one day in jail."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Russell's sister, Michelle, called for peaceful protests and stressed the ruling was not the final word.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "He's not going to dodge this just because he was acquitted," she said. "God will have the final say."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But the U.S. Justice Department may get a crack at the case first. A review of evidence in the state trial could lead to a federal civil rights prosecution of Brelo, who was facing 22 years in prison before being cleared of voluntary manslaughter.

\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  An antiterrorism court on Friday remanded Muttahida Qaumi Movement leader Amir Khan in judicial custody in a case of instigating terrorism and harbouring criminals.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 After the end of his one-week physical remand, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  produced the MQM leader in court again amid tight security. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The investigating \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  submitted that he be sent to prison as his custody was no longer needed for questioning. The ATC-II judge sent Amir Khan to prison on judicial remand till June 25 and asked the IO to submit an investigation report till next hearing.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Defence lawyer Shaukat Hayat moved an application seeking B-class (better facilities) in prison for the MQM leader by submitting that his client was entitled to it under Section 248 of the Prison Rules as he was a postgraduate and also a taxpayer.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The court provisionally allowed the application subject to the verification of the degree and tax record.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The MQM leader was picked up with dozens of other suspects by the Rangers in a pre-dawn raid on and around the party headquarters Nine Zero in Azizabad on March 11.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 While placing them under 90-day preventive detention, the paramilitary force had informed a court that they had credible information about their alleged involvement in crimes related to targeted killing and terrorism.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 On June 4, the Rangers handed over the MQM leader to the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  after registering a case against him and others for allegedly harbouring criminals and using them for terrorist activities and the following day he was remanded in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  custody for a week.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to the FIR, besides around 59 suspects, including Amir Khan, placed under preventive detention, the paramilitary force had also arrested during the March 11 raid 26 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed suspects\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , including Faisal Mehmood alias Faisal Mota, who was sentenced to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by a court in absentia for the murder of journalist Wali Khan Babar; Obaid alias K2, who was wanted in many cases; and Noman alias Nomi, an absconder in the Advocate Niamat Ali Randhawa murder case.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It alleged that the MQM leader and others admitted during questioning that Amir Khan was in charge of the party headquarters security and he with Minhaj Qazi, Raees Mama, Shahzad Mullah, Imran Ijaz Niazi and Naeem alias Mullah had allegedly provided shelter to arrested criminals and had been using them for terrorist activities in the city.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A joint investigation team recommended the registration of a case against the MQM leader and others, the FIR concluded.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The case was registered at the Azizabad \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  station on a complaint of Rangers Deputy Superintendent Ashraf Hussain under Sections 11V (directing terrorist activities), 21J (harbouring any person who committed an offence under this act) and 7 (punishment for act of terrorism) of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997.

\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have issued a warrant for the arrest of a 34-year-old Surrey man wanted in the Mother's Day domestic slaying of a young mom. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Gordon Alexander David, also known as Alex David, is accused of killing his wife, Cady Quaw, 23. He is wanted for manslaughter and aggravated assault, and is believed to be armed and dangerous.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Integrated Homicide Investigation Team issued the notice Monday, a day after \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  found Quaw injured in a basement suite in the 9400-block 140th Street. Quaw succumbed to her injuries in hospital.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Another woman was also found injured in the home. She remains in stable condition.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Rita Quaw was stunned to hear about the news of her cousin's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It was a shock," said the 38-yearold Penticton woman. "I felt like it's finally sunk in today. I babysat her for most of my life, and I feel like crap."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Quaw has a large family who are grieving their loss. She leaves behind a daughter, who she took care of in Surrey, and a son, who lived in northern B.C., said Rita.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Her cousin was a soft-spoken and quiet woman, but strong, said Rita: "She was going through a lot of stuff, but she was very loving, especially towards her dad and mom and brothers and sister."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Rita said Quaw spent her childhood on the Saik'uz First Nation reserve outside Vanderhoof. David was from the same reserve and the two grew up together.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But she had fallen out of touch with her cousin, whom she last saw in 2009.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "She was like a daughter to me growing up.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I wish I had the chance to repair our relationship before this happened," she said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Provincial court records show David has a long criminal history and has been a repeat visitor to many B.C. courthouses, from Vanderhoof and Fort St. James to Surrey, Vancouver and New Westminster.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He was expected to appear in New Westminster court later this month on a slew of charges, including assault, uttering threats, theft, robbery and breaches.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 David is described as five-foot-six, about 160 pounds, with black hair, brown eyes and a slim build. On his right forearm is a tattoo of comedy and tragedy masks and skulls.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Anyone who knows the whereabouts of David shouldn't approach him, but should call 911, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  said. chchan@theprovince.com twitter.com/cherylchan !@COPYRIGHT=\'a9 2015 Postmedia Network Inc. All rights reserved.

\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A STREET vendor was killed in the crossfire between security guards and robbers at the Gugulethu Mall on Friday.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Farai Fambira, a 39-year-old Zimbabwean, made a living selling DVDs, CDs and padlocks at the entrance of the mall, to support his wife and three children who live in Zimbabwe. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Fambira had just set up his stall when a group of five robbers attempted to rob a cash-in-transit vehicle.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Witnesses said Fambira hid behind a dairy truck when the shooting started.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We all fell to the ground as soon as we heard the gunshots. Rasta (Fambira) hid behind that truck because it was closest to his stall."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Witnesses say that the security guards may have mistaken Fambira for a robber.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We kept shouting that he wasn't one of the robbers but the security guards just wouldn't stop shooting.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "There were many shots, the two guards were standing over Rasta and one was even kicking him," said street vendor Phumeza Mangaliso.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  spokesman Andr\'c3\'a8 Traut confirmed the incident and said one of the robbers was injured and was in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  custody.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Five \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed suspects\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  opened fire on two security \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  who were transporting cash, and in the crossfire a male bystander was fatally wounded. One of the suspects was wounded and subsequently arrested and is being treated ," said Traut.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said the security guards escaped unharmed and no cash was stolen.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The remaining four suspects fled the scene and are yet to be arrested. The matter is still under investigation."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Togar Mabharani, Fambira's relative said he was woken by people who were at the scene when his cousin was killed.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "According to the witnesses they tried to shout and inform the security guards that he was not one of the robbers but they went ahead and shot him |anyway.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "He was not a criminal, he just sold his things to feed his family," says Mabharani.

\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A BRITISH "Wolverine" wannabe who slaughtered three family members before fleeing the scene has been found dead, cops said Monday.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Authorities found the body of Jed Allen, a 21-year-old obsessed with the hairy, clawed comic book character, in a wooded area in Oxford, some 13 miles north of the gruesome triple-murder scene in Didcot. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The family home in the tranquil Thames Valley was turned into a blood-spattered mess after the disturbed, knife-obsessed Allen went on a Saturday rampage, murdering his mother, Janet Jordon, 48; her boyfriend, Philip Howard, 44, and the couple's 6-year-old daughter, Derrin - his sister.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Members of the public reported finding the body of a man in a wooded area in Oxford, in Marston Road," Detective Superintendent Chris Ward, of the Thames Valley \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  said at a news conference Monday evening, Sky News reported. "This is an area that had not been previously searched by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as a result of this investigation.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "No formal identification has taken place but I am satisfied that this is the body of Jed Allen, who I had previously named as a suspect in this investigation," Ward said. "The members of all of the victims' families have been informed, and they are being supported by specially trained \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "While the investigation into this matter will continue, I am not seeking anybody else in connection with the offense," he added. "I would like to offer my condolences to all of the families of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 victims\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in this tragic case."
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Armed police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  had been desperately seeking the tattooed weightlifter, who had posted a series of bizarre, rambling videos online before the triple homicide. He also left dozens of photos on his social media accounts, detailing a fascination with weapons and brooding comic book anti-heroes, primarily X-Men's Wolverine.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Allen, sporting the character's signature sideburns, posed in one selfie with serrated steak knives arranged between his fingers like claws.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "F--- it's wolverine," he wrote in the caption.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In other pics, he brandished an ax, bolt clippers and a 10-inch hunting knife.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It's unclear how the wanted killer died.

\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 May 11--A hearing is scheduled in state district court this week for a Caddo Mills woman facing multiple charges of armed robbery in connection with a reported July 2014 carjacking in Greenville. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A second defendant charged in the same incident reportedly committed suicide after being sought in connection with an unrelated murder case.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Amber Rae Melton has pleaded not guilty to three indictments for aggravated robbery with a deadly weapon.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A pretrial hearing is set Tuesday morning in the 354th District Court, with jury selection currently scheduled for June 1.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The indictments involve the alleged \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 victims\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of an \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  robbery reported in Greenville early on the morning of July 19, 2014.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Melton was alleged to have been acting alongside Thomas Isaac Medlin of Dallas in the theft of a pickup truck at gunpoint. Melton remains in custody at the Hunt County Jail.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Three individuals told \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0   with the Greenville \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Department they met Medlin and Melton at a local store and agreed to give them a ride across town in a 2005 Chevrolet pick-up. Upon arrival in the 4100 Block of Park Street, Medlin allegedly produced a handgun, ordered the three men to exit the vehicle and to leave the contents of their pockets in the truck. Medlin and Melton then allegedly left in the stolen truck.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Medlin pleaded guilty in September 2014 to a reduced charge of robbery and was released on probation.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But an arrest warrant on a charge of murder was later issued for Medlin, involving the Nov. 10, 2014 homicide of Eddie Cabellero Lopez in Greenville.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A Nov. 14, 2014 law enforcement manhunt near Wolfe City in connection with Lopez's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  resulted in Medlin's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0

\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 TWO Portland men were remanded in custody yesterday after being charged with serious assault offences relating to a horrific home invasion.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Daniel Hollands, 27, of Finn Street, did not apply for bail, while Payton Reiri, 22, of Daniel Street, was refused bail in the Warrnambool Magistrates Court. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 They were remanded in custody until a filing hearing on September 22.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  alleged Mr Hollands, Mr Reiri and other armed men went to a Portland home in Waratah Crescent on Thursday last week and bashed and stabbed a drug dealer.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The victim suffered a severe laceration to his left cheek which exposed his teeth and required 27 stitches .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Other injuries included multiple fractures to his arms, legs, fingers, knee, feet and face. He is expected to remain in a Melbourne hospital for about 10 weeks.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A 16-year-old girl was also hit with a baseball bat, suffering a fracture to her back, and the incident happened while there was a nine-year-old boy in the home.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Detective Sergeant James Sullivan, of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  crime squad, told the court the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 victim\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was a low-level drug dealer and Mr Hollands was his competition. He said the victim was told to stop trafficking drugs, threatened and told to leave Portland, which he did.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But he had recently returned and there was an $18,000 bounty on his head for anyone who assaulted him.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Detective Sergeant Sullivan said the reason the girl was assaulted was because she had not told Mr Hollands and Mr Reiri the victim was back in town. He said the girl told \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officers that police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  had "signed her \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  warrant" if Mr Hollands and Mr Reiri were released from custody.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 One of the offences the men have been charged with, intentionally causing serious injury in circumstances of gross violence, carries a minimum four-year jail sentence.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Detective Sergeant Sullivan said it was usual that the only question Mr Reiri asked of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was who had named him.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said to call it a stabbing was to understate the action of Mr Hollands, with the victim's wound going from high on the cheekbone to the jaw.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "He has deliberately run the blade along his face," Detective Sergeant Sullivan said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Detective Senior Constable Tim McKerracher said Mr Reiri was armed with a metal baseball bat and Mr Hollands with a knife. He said the men surrounded the home and then forced entry by kicking in the front and back door. When the victim tried to barricade himself in a bedroom, the men forced their way in and struck him more than 50 times.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He was dragged out of the bedroom, struck about 200 times and then stabbed the man to the face by Mr Hollands while he was held down by Mr Reiri.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Detective Senior Constable McKerracher said \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were hopeful of identifying other co-accused and now that the two men had been arrested it was likely other witnesses would come forward.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Magistrate John Lesser refused bail, saying Mr Reiri was an unacceptable risk of interfering with witnesses and reoffending.

\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 About 42 people were, yesterday, reportedly killed in Benue and Plateau States during separate attacks by unknown gunmen.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Twenty seven persons were said to have been killed in some communities in Barkin Ladi Local Government Area of Plateau State while 15 others were killed at the popular Kyado Market in Ukum Local Government Area of Benue State, bringing the total number of those killed in the two neighbouring states to 42. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The victims in Plateau State were killed during a night attack despite the curfew imposed on the area.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In Benue, the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 victims\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were killed Wednesday afternoon when unknown \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  men opened fire on traders at the market even as many, including children, also sustained varying degrees of injuries at the marker popularly known for its booming yam trade.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 However, Barkin Ladi in Plateau was one of the seven local governments where curfew was imposed but night attacks had been going on daily for about three weeks now with many people mostly women and children being killed.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Chairman of the council, Emmanuel Loman, who confirmed the attack, yesterday, blamed the incident on some Fulani herdsmen who he said attacked both Ninji and Popp villages without provocation, killing 20 persons.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said: "As I talk to you, I am at the mass burial of 27 people killed by the Fulani and their mercenaries. The act is being perpetrated by the Fulani who live in the communities and aided by their mercenaries. The attackers want to make Barkin Ladi another Sambisa forest at all cost."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He, therefore, called on security operatives to be proactive as the situation was getting out of hand.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Residents of the area and neighbouring Riyom Local Government Area had been also under severe attack in the last three days with many residents relocating to other areas for fear of being killed.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Also, in Makurdi, the Benue State capital, an eye witness told Vanguard that the gunmen, who were about six in number, stormed the ever busy market located close to Wukari, along the Benue-Taraba State border, at about 12:30pm at the peak of trading activities
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "They stormed the market in a commando manner, when business activities were at peak at about 12:30pm, and suddenly opened fire on the traders and their customers, most of whom were trading in tubers of yam.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "There was pandemonium everywhere, people, including children, started scampering in different directions but unfortunately, about 13 persons were killed by the gunmen, while many also sustained injuries.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "After the sporadic shooting which lasted about 10 minutes, the gunmen retreated to the car they came in and drove off."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Contacted, Benue State \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Public Relations \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Officer,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  PPRO, Assistant Superintendent, ASP, Austin Ezeani, confirmed the killings, saying the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  recorded the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of three persons and five cases of injuries in the incident.

\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 anipur, June 5 -- In a devastating ambush this morning on a five-vehicle convoy of the 6-Dogra Regiment in the Moltuk area of Chandel district of Manipur, 110 km from Tengnoupal \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Police\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Station, close to the Indo-Myanmar border, at least 17 soldiers were reported killed and 16 others injured. The soldiers who had completed their posting at the remote Moltuk village were leaving with their bags and baggage, and probably with home in mind rather than a gunfight, putting themselves off guard and therefore made extremely vulnerable. The attackers probably also had intelligence of this vulnerable moment and timed the ambush accordingly. Claims are now beginning to come to newspaper offices, and so far they confirm suspicions that this could have been the handiwork of the newly formed, United Liberation Front of Western South East Asia, ULFWSEA, constituting of a number of insurgent groups from the Northeast, under the leadership of SS Khaplang, the chief of the National Socialist Council of Nagaland, NSCN, faction with which the Government of India had only recently called off its ceasefire.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Khaplang on the other hand still holds a ceasefire with the Myanmar government. Nearly all of the insurgent groups from not just Manipur but also the entire Northeast, now have their bases in Myanmar enjoying the safe sanctuary provided by Khaplang. The Government of India ended its truce with Khaplang faction of the NSCN thinking it to have been reduced to a spent force in India, and to pursue peace with the stronger rival NSCN faction led by Isak Swu and Thuingaleng Muivah with which it has been holding peace talks since 1997. Today's ambush could be Khaplang's message that he can still hit back within Indian territory in many different ways, apart from dramatically announcing the arrival of ULFSEA.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Today's deadly ambush changed the complexion of a public outrage building up over the killing of a woman, M Ruisoting Aimol, a 56 year old social activist belonging to a small tribe Aimol in the Chandel district, by troops of the 20 Assam Rifles posted at Bonyang village. According to the villagers, the soldiers, accompanied by an \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  came to the village in a white Maruti Gypsy with some masked men at 9.45pm on May 31 and searched out the woman. They then planted some incriminating items at her place before shooting and injuring her. Villagers thereafter brought her to a hospital in Imphal where she succumbed to her injury on June 2. The villagers further allege that the soldiers had also earlier come to the village at 11.35pm on June 27 and harassed the villagers. The news of this atrocity remained lost in the din of the hotly contested Autonomous District Council elections in the hill districts, polling for which was held on June 1. However after the dust of the electioneering settled, public attention shifted back to the case of the murdered woman. The Aimol tribe called a general strike, and several civil society bodies all over the state responded to the call. However, no sooner did the strike begin, it was called off following a truce brokered by the Manipur government between the aggrieved Aimol tribe and the Assam Rifles. In Manipur's absurd theatre today, even grief and mourning are open to bargain and negotiation. This is understandable, considering the climate of official impunity introduced by the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Armed\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Forces Special Powers Act. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Victims\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  virtually have no guarantee at all that perpetrators will be punished, so rather than lose everything, the intuition now is to bargain for some material compensation at least. In most cases the price demanded is a government job or cash.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Today's devastating ambush and the atrocious killing of the Aimol woman a few days earlier, illustrate the tragedy of a violent civil strife and the dilemma before the liberal State to come up with a liberal answer; a failure of the moral imagination. Often, in the AFSPA debate so sensitive in the Northeast region, the two kinds of violence are so falsely aligned on the "us versus them" binary, making them either the justification or else a case for condemning draconian measures of the State. The AFSPA debate thus gets reduced to the instrumental "you hit me first" rhetoric, or that of extraordinary situations deserving extraordinary measures. Lost in the process is the ethical question of whether the end always justifies the means. Placing the two kinds of violence on opposite poles is also false for one more thing. The objection to the AFSPA is not so much to the military meeting a military challenge to the State. It is more about making the atrocities committed under the AFSPA accountable to democratic law. This is what the Justice Jeevan Reddy Committee's recommendation on the AFSPA said in 2005; this is also what the Veerappa Moily Administrative Reform Committee 2005 recommended; this is what Santosh Hegde Commission on encounter \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 deaths\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Manipur 2013 also said. Let the AFSPA debate then not be swayed by the immediate and instead be thrashed out on the moral plane.

\par \b0 \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Maurice Henderson is a fiddler on Fetlar (population 69), a beautiful island in the Shetland archipelago 150 or so miles north of the Scottish mainland, and has spent his life bringing the old music and tales of his native land to a new global audience.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Yet he would not have existed at all had his great-great-great-greatgreat-great-grandfather not saved his great-great-greatgreat-great-great-grandmother from the nest of a hungry eagle, high on sea cliffs a few miles from what is now the Henderson family croft house.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It was my grand-uncle who told me I was descended from the eagle's bairn," the 40-year-old says. "It's a story handed down by folk on the isle for generations."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This is how it goes. One late summer's day in 1690 on the island of Unst, a white-tailed eagle - a bird with an 8ft wingspan also known as the sea eagle - swooped down to the fields where the Anderson family were gathering barley and picked up in its scimitar talons their infant daughter Mary, who had been lying sleeping in a woollen shawl. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The bird set off across the water to its eyrie on the neighbouring island of Fetlar, three miles south. Mary's father William and fellow crofters set off in pursuit, crossing the water in an old leaky boat, straining to see the black dot in the sky. Landing on Fetlar, they made for the cliffs and, arriving above the spot where the bird was known to nest, let down a rope 400ft above the water.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A local boy, Robert Nicolson, being light and used to climbing, volunteered to descend to the nest. There he found Mary asleep and unharmed, the thick shawl having protected her from hungry beaks. He gathered her to him, climbed back up the rope and handed her to her grateful father.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Some years later, Nicolson had business on Unst and took a notion to visit the Anderson croft to pay his respects to Mary. He found her grown into a pretty young woman. "It was love at first sight," says Maurice Henderson, "or, as they say, second sight." The two married and raised a family. Their descendants - the bairns of the eagle's bairn - still live on the islands and are proud of their ancestry.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The sea eagle has not been so fortunate in its genealogy. The last in the UK was killed in Shetland in 1918. The female bird had lived for years without a mate and was said to be an albino, the end of her line, a ghost even before she was shot dead.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This story illustrates the complex and often uneasy relationship between humans and sea eagles, a relationship that led to their dying out in Britain almost 100 years ago and to their reintroduction from Norway in the 1970s. As that grim centenary approaches, it is thought that the milestone of there being 100 breeding pairs is about to be reached. We killed them and then we brought them back to life.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The sea eagle was brought to extinction through man's persecution, so it seemed only right that we should do something to bring it back," says the naturalist and author John Love. "Righting a wrong that had been done to it in the past."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Love, 68, was hired by the former Nature Conservancy Council in 1975 to manage the reintroduction programme. Over the next decade he made several journeys to Norway, where sea eagles are relatively abundant, to choose chicks in their nests and accompany them back - in RAF Nimrods - to Scotland.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The first bird, Loki, was released on the Hebridean island of Rum on September 26, 1975. Love remembers the moment vividly, its historic weight. "I got the same buzz every time I released one into the world," he says.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The sea eagle is Britain's biggest bird of prey. Its relationship with the people of these isles goes back to ancient times; they may even have been sacred to us. When the "Tomb of the Eagles", a Stone Age burial mound, was excavated in Orkney in 1976, it was found to contain talons and skulls of sea eagles, mingled with the bones of prehistoric humans.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Pictish symbol stones and the Book of Kells show the great hooked beak.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Anglo-Saxon poetry describes sea eagles feasting on the flesh of slain warriors. Gaelic poetry calls it "iolaire suil na greine" - the eagle of the sunlit eye. Those golden eyes, which now scan some of Scotland's wildest landscape, once looked down over the whole of the British Isles.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Farmers, gamekeepers and sportsmen hastened the demise of the sea eagle. Estate owners regarded them as vermin preying on valuable sheep and game birds, and offered bounties for eggs and severed heads. By 1800 there were none left in England (an attempt five years ago to reintroduce them in East Anglia failed in the face of local opposition).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The last bird in the UK, that albino in Shetland, was photographed a few years before its \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 death.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Blurred and grainy, it is the only picture taken of a true native British sea eagle and there is something guilt-inducing and wraithlike about it; a phantom accusing its killers.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Although initial reintroductions took place on Rum in 1975, 10 years passed before breeding succeeded and a chick hatched - the first "Gaelic-speaking sea eagle", as Love puts it, to be born in Scotland for decades. This happened on Mull, a large island south of Rum, to which the birds had spread. It was May 4, 1985, and on the 30th anniversary Dave Sexton, a Royal Society for the Protection of Birds \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 officer\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  who witnessed the hatching, leads the way down a rough track and points out the site of the nest where new birds are raising young. "This is where it all began," he says. "This wood should be a national monument."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Sea eagles are protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act, with a maximum penalty of six months imprisonment and/or fines of up to \'a35,000. The Mull birds have been targeted by egg thieves in the past; some nests are protected by security cameras and razor wire. There are 20 nests on Mull, the exact locations of which are kept hush-hush.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 These are valuable birds from both an environmental and economic perspective. Mull is marketed as "Eagle Island" and it is estimated that the birds attract \'a35m of tourism a year. Even on a wet day the open deck of the Mull Charters boat is busy with visitors wowing at the sea eagles swooping down to take fish from Loch Buie.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Is that not the most spectacular thing you've ever seen?" asks Martin Keivers, the boat's skipper. Perhaps, but "spectacular" is not the right word. "Awesome", in its true sense, is better. "Dreadful" would be better still. A sea eagle in silhouette, circling 100ft above, has a heavy, oppressive, almost hostile presence that brings to mind a bomber aircraft. You can all but hear the engine of the Junkers.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The trick is to balance the magnetic pull these birds exert on tourists with the need to keep them safe. An informal network of islanders observes the nests and reports any suspicious characters to the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 police.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Mary van Heerden, known as "Eagle Mary", is 69 and moved to Mull from Zimbabwe 10 years ago, feeling forced out of the country amid growing security fears. She had been the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 victim\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of an \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 armed\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  robbery that left her traumatised.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 She started running a B&B on Mull, but suffered periods of depression until one day in 2007 Sexton asked her to keep an eye on a pair of eagles about to nest. She has watched them ever since, enjoying the sound of the wind in their wings as they fly overhead.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "After two or three hours, I come back feeling all is right with the world," she says. "It has been a wonderful therapy. I pride myself that I've never taken antidepressants. I've never had counselling. These eagles are better."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Not everyone regards them so positively. Many farmers on Mull would happily see them die out once more. Sheep farming is an important part of the island's culture and economy; lamb is part of the sea eagle diet. Between those two facts lies anger and conflict.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It's an escalating problem," says Lachlan MacLean, 55, the third generation of his family to farm on Mull. "It's having a huge impact."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 MacLean farms 10,000 acres and keeps 2,500 ewes. It was on his land, in 1985, that the first sea eagle hatched. But he takes no pride in this. That beak poking free from the egg was, for him, the beginning of a disaster. He says there are now four nests on the farm, four on the periphery and a number of non-nesting juveniles. "We're surrounded." Putting a number on the livestock he loses to sea eagles is difficult, he admits, but says the losses are significant. A lamb sells for about \'a360 and females are worth more than that in subsidy. A new scheme offers financial support to farmers who have nests on their land.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But MacLean says he is still losing money and would like bird numbers to be somehow controlled, or for compensation to be paid by the Scottish government.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There is a feeling among farmers that these birds have been imposed on them and - although no sea eagle on Mull has been shot since reintroduction - a sense of envy of great-grandfathers who were not prevented by law from taking action.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There are thought to be about 50 or so sea eagles on Mull, although there are also populations across the Hebrides, down the west coast and on the other side of the country in Fife. It is likely that this month, or next, the 100th breeding pair will be confirmed. "That feels like an important milestone," says Sexton. And the future? "I would say that 250 pairs in Scotland over the next 20, 30 years is a reasonable target."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This will be music to the ears of conservationists and tourist businesses, but for MacLean it sounds a discordant note. "They were extinct for a reason," he says. "We were better off prior to the birds being here."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Back on Shetland, Henderson is walking along the cliffs, high above the hungry sea. We have been to the old ruined croft where the bird is said to have lifted the bairn and we are now on Fetlar, looking for the site of the nest. Henderson is a member of the folk group Fiddlers' Bid and keen on the folklore of these islands, but this is the first time he has made this pilgrimage, following the flight of the eagle. It is an auspicious moment.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The local press is reporting the arrival of sea eagles on Orkney, to the south, so it's only a matter of time before they are back on Shetland, the scene of their extinction becoming a cradle of their resurrection.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He stands near the edge, looking down on the crag where he believes the nest must have been. Strange to think if that boy long ago hadn't had the courage to climb down a rope and rescue a baby, their descendant would not now be taking pictures. That's if you believe the legend. Henderson does and is grateful. "I would have missed out on a lot of fiddle tunes," he laughs.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 That sea eagle almost cost him his life. We have cost the eagles theirs. Now humans and birds must learn to live together. It is, as Sexton puts it, "an uneasy peace" at times, but one, surely, that is worth trying to keep.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Spectacular is not the right word. Dreadful is better. A sea eagle 100ft above has a heavy, almost hostile presence that brings to mind a bomber. You can all but hear the engine of the Junkers
