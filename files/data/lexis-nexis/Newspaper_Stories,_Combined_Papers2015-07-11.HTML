<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was not yet 9 a.m., and Gary Page was drunk. The disabled handyman had a long history of schizophrenia and depression and, since his wife died in February, he had been struggling to hold his life together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That bright Saturday morning in March, something snapped. Page, 60, slit his wrists, grabbed a gun and climbed the stairs to his stepdaughter's place in the Pines Apartments in Harmony, Ind. He said he wanted to die. And then he called 911.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want to shoot the cops,&quot; Page slurred to the dispatcher, prodding his stepdaughter to confirm that, yes, he had a gun. &quot;I want them to shoot me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minutes later, Page's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> wish was granted. Two Clay County </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">sheriff's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deputies</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> arrived to find that he had taken a neighbor hostage. They opened fire, striking him five times in the torso and once in the head. Page's gun later turned out to be a starter pistol, loaded only with blanks. His threats of violence turned out to be equally empty, the product of emotional instability and agonizing despair.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nationwide, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have shot and killed 124 people this year who, like Page, were in the throes of mental or emotional crisis, according to a Washington Post analysis. The dead account for a quarter of the 462 people shot to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the first six months of 2015.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vast majority were armed, but in most cases, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who shot them were not responding to reports of a crime. More often, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were called by relatives, neighbors or other bystanders worried that a mentally fragile person was behaving erratically, reports show. More than 50 people were explicitly suicidal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than half of the killings involved </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> agencies that have not provided their </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with state-of-the-art training to deal with the mentally ill. And in many cases, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> responded with tactics that quickly made a volatile situation even more dangerous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Post analysis provides for the first time a national, real-time tally of the shooting </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deaths</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of mentally distraught individuals at the hands of law enforcement. Criminal-justice experts say that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are often ill equipped to respond to such individuals - and that the encounters too often end in needless violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This a national crisis,&quot; said Chuck Wexler, executive director of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Executive Research Forum, an independent research organization devoted to improving policing. &quot;We have to get American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to rethink how they handle encounters with the mentally ill. Training has to change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a debate rages over the use of deadly force by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> particularly against minorities, The Post is tracking every </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">fatal</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shooting by a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> acting in the line of duty in 2015. Reporters are culling news reports, public records and other open sources on the Internet to log more than a dozen factors about each case, including the age and race of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">victim, whether the victim was armed</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the circumstances that led to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">fatal</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> encounter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FBI also logs </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">fatal</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shootings, but officials acknowledge that their data is far from complete. In the past four decades, the FBI has never recorded more than 460 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">fatal</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shootings in a single year. The Post hit that number in less than six months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For this article, The Post analyzed 124 killings in which the victim's mental health appeared to play a role, either because the person expressed suicidal intentions or because </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or family members confirmed a history of mental illness. This approach probably understates the scope of the problem, experts said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In many ways, this subset mirrors the overall population of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shooting victims: They were overwhelmingly men, and more than half of them were white. Nine in 10 were armed with some kind of weapon, and most died close to home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there were also important distinctions. This group was more likely to wield a weapon less lethal than a firearm. Six had toy guns; 3 in 10 carried a blade, such as a knife or a machete - weapons that rarely prove deadly to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. According to data maintained by the FBI and other organizations, only three </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have been killed with an edged weapon in the past decade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly a dozen of the mentally distraught people killed were military veterans, many of them suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of their service, according to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or family members. Another was a former California Highway Patrol </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who had been forced into retirement after enduring a severe beating during a traffic stop that left him suffering from depression and PTSD.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And in 45 cases, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were called to help someone get medical treatment, or after the person had tried and failed to get treatment on his own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In January, for instance, Jonathan Guillory, a white 32-year-old father of two who had worked as a military contractor in Afghanistan, was having what his widow called a mental health emergency. He sought help at a Veterans Affairs hospital in Arizona, his wife, Maria Garcia, told local reporters, but the busy hospital turned him away. Jean Schaefer, a spokeswoman for the Veterans Health Administration in Phoenix, said the hospital had no record of Guillory's visit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back home, Guillory dialed 911 twice and hung up. When </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> responded, he pulled a gun from his waistband and said, &quot;I bet I can outdraw you,&quot; according to Maricopa </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> spokesman Ricardo Alvarado. They shot him six times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dead range in age from 15 to 86. At both ends of that spectrum, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">victim</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was male, suicidal and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with a gun. On average, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shot and killed someone who was in mental crisis every 36 hours in the first six months of this year. On April 25, three mentally ill men were gunned down within 10 hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That afternoon, David Felix, a 24-year-old black man with schizophrenia, was killed by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the New York apartment building where he lived with other men undergoing treatment for mental health problems, according to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> reports. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said he struck two </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with a heavy </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> radio after they tried to serve him with a warrant for allegedly punching a friend in the face and stealing her purse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two hours later, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">sheriff's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deputies</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Clermont, Fla., fatally shot Daniel Davis, a 58-year-old white man who had recently been released from a mental health facility, according to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> reports. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> say he threatened his stepfather and then a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deputy</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with a hunting knife.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And shortly before midnight, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Victoria, Tex., shot Brandon Lawrence, a 25-year-old white man, a father of two toddlers and an Afghanistan war veteran who suffered from PTSD. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said Lawrence approached them in an &quot;aggressive manner&quot; with a two-foot-long machete. They said they ordered him to drop it more than 30 times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawrence's wife and another witness have disputed aspects of that account, saying that Lawrence, while armed, was not advancing and was obviously not in his right mind. Convinced someone was coming to kill him, Lawrence repeatedly asked </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who they were and what they wanted, his wife said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was clearly confused . . . but they didn't try to talk to him,&quot; said Lawrence's father, Bryon Lawrence, who works as an Illinois state prison guard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everyone I work with is a convicted felon; I can't just go up to them and shoot them,&quot; Bryon Lawrence said. &quot;My boy is 25 years old, working 50 hours a week, paying taxes. He was in his own home when they showed up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Within six minutes, they murdered him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Victoria </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> declined to comment, citing the ongoing investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> increasingly acknowledge that they have few effective tools for handling the mentally ill. In interviews, current and former </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> chiefs said that without large-scale </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> retraining, as well as a nationwide increase in mental health services, these deadly encounters will continue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Severe budget cuts for psychiatric services - by as much as 30 percent in some states in recent years - have created a vacuum that local </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are increasingly asked to fill, they said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We as a society need to put more money and funding into treating the mentally ill. We need to work with these people . . . before they end in tragedy,&quot; said Mike Carter, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> chief in Sand Springs, Okla., where </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in April shot and killed a 66-year-old white Vietnam veteran with PTSD. The man, Donald Allen, grew agitated after </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> asked him to stop firing a gun in his back yard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> departments generally have not risen to the challenge. Although new recruits typically spend nearly 60 hours learning to handle a gun, according to a recent survey by the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Executive Research Forum, they receive only eight hours of training to de-escalate tense situations and eight hours learning strategies for handling the mentally ill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Otherwise, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are taught to employ tactics that tend to be counterproductive in such encounters, experts said. For example, most </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are trained to seize control when dealing with an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed suspect,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> often through stern, shouted commands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But yelling and pointing guns is &quot;like pouring gasoline on a fire when you do that with the mentally ill,&quot; said Ron Honberg, policy director with the National Alliance on Mental Illness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sandy Jo MacArthur is an assistant chief who oversees &quot;mental response teams&quot; for the Los Angeles </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Department, a program considered to be a national model. MacArthur said her </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are trained to embrace tactics that may seem counterintuitive. Instead of rushing to take someone into custody, they try to slow things down and persuade the person to come with them. When possible, a psychologist or psychiatrist is on the scene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mentally ill &quot;do not process what is happening like a normal criminal,&quot; MacArthur said. &quot;There's a lot of white noise in their head.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the day he died in April, Daniel Covarrubias was taking powerful painkillers for a broken collarbone, hadn't eaten for days and was hallucinating. The 37-year-old Native American and Latino had gone to St. Clare Hospital near Tacoma, Wash., &quot;to get the cameras out of his eyes,&quot; according to Ben Barcus, attorney for the Covarrubias family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Covarrubias, who had a history of depression and drug addiction, was treated for &quot;substance/medication induced psychotic disorder,&quot; according to medical records obtained by the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Five hours later, he was released &quot;in stable condition,&quot; according to hospital spokesman Scott Thompson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Covarrubias walked home, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sirens began blaring behind him. For reasons that are unclear, Covarrubias dashed into Pinnacle Lumber and Plywood, scaled a 25-foot-tall stack of wood and crouched to hide, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> records show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His mother, Marilyn Covarrubias, speculates that he may have believed the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were after him. &quot;I think he thought the sirens were for him,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alarmed lumberyard employees thought so, too, and called </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to report a man hiding on the property. Within minutes, two Lakewood, Wash., </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were standing at the base of the lumber stack, shouting up at Covarrubias to &quot;show your hands.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What happened next is in dispute. Lakewood </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chief Mike Zaro has said  Covarrubias &quot;raised up with a dark object in his hand and pointed it at the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in a manner that was consistent with pointing a firearm.&quot; Barcus said lumberyard employees &quot;didn't see pointing.&quot; Managers at Pinnacle Lumber declined to comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In any case, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> opened fire, hitting Covarrubias five times, including once in the head, according to Barcus. The dark object in his hand turned out to be a cellphone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barcus criticized the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers'</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> failure &quot;to de-escalate this situation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They arrived at the lumberyard, and six minutes later Covarrubias was dead,&quot; Barcus said. &quot;It doesn't appear they know how to deal with the mentally ill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lakewood </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> spokesman Chris Lawler said the department works with mental health experts and that both </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> involved in the shooting had received training to handle such encounters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He declined to comment further, saying the investigation was still pending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the youngest shooting victims was Kristiana Coignard, a 17-year-old white girl who walked out of the darkness one evening in January and into the empty lobby of a Longview, Tex., </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> station. In her waistband, she had a knife. And on her palm, she had written the words &quot;I have a gun.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coignard did not have a gun, nor any clear reason for going to the station that night. Her case underscores a central difficulty for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who encounter a mentally ill person: It can be almost impossible to determine intent, or judge capacity to inflict harm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coignard appeared to pose a threat, but unlike someone committing a robbery, her intentions were obscure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the age of 12, Coignard had displayed signs of mental illness; she regularly took medication for depression and bipolar disorder, according to her father, Erik Coignard. She dropped out of high school a year before graduation, but she later obtained a GED and had plans to attend college.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She wanted to be a counselor in the mental health area because she said she felt that they failed her,&quot; said her stepmother, Elizabeth Coignard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the day she died, Kristiana Coignard met with the counselor she had seen for years. She entered the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> station shortly before 6:30 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a video released by Longview </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Coignard at first seems hesitant. She wanders in, checks her mobile phone, then approaches a phone on the far wall that connects to dispatch. After a minute or so, she picks up the receiver and asks to speak to an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> arrives and addresses Coignard, who appears to show him her palm. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> struggles with the teen, forcing her into a chair, then down to the ground. She reaches for the knife, and the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> draws his gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As two more </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> arrive, Coignard stands and charges at the first </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who opens fire. Coignard falls to the floor, struck four times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As colleagues comfort the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> paramedics arrive, perform CPR on Coignard and carry her body away on a stretcher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Longview </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chief Don Dingler has defended the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers'</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> actions. The video shows &quot;time was a factor,&quot; Dingler told reporters. &quot;There was no time for the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to use other means.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coignard's parents strongly disagree. Though they are baffled by their daughter's actions that day - was it a suicide attempt? - they don't understand why three </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> couldn't subdue their slight teenage daughter without resorting to deadly force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever her motives, &quot;she should still be here,&quot; Erik Coignard said. &quot;She was asking for help, and she was failed when that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> failed to take control of the situation. . . . This shouldn't have ended this way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mental health experts say most </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> departments need to quadruple the amount of training that recruits receive for dealing with the mentally ill, requiring as much time in the crisis-intervention classroom as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> currently spend on the shooting range. But training is no panacea, experts caution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mentally ill are unpredictable. Moreover, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> often have no way of knowing when they are dealing with a mentally ill person. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are routinely dispatched with information that is incomplete or wrong. And in a handful of cases this year, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were prodded to shoot someone who wanted to die.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That was the case with Matthew Hoffman, a 32-year-old white man who had long struggled with mental illness, according to family members. After breaking up with his girlfriend, Hoffman walked up to San Francisco </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in January outside a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> station in the bustling Mission District. He pulled a gun from his waistband, pointed it at the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and advanced in silence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The startled </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> fired 10 shots, three of which struck Hoffman. They later discovered that his weapon was a BB gun. And they found a note on his mobile phone, addressed to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who shot him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You did nothing wrong,&quot; it said. &quot;You ended the life of a man who was too much of a coward to do it himself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grace Gatpandan, San Francisco </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Department spokeswoman, said the department offers crisis-intervention training. But those classes are designed primarily to teach </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to handle someone threatening to jump off a bridge, not someone pointing a gun in a crowded tourist area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are faced with a deadly situation, when there is a gun pointed at a cop, there is no time to go into mental health measures,&quot; Gatpandan said. &quot;There was nothing we could have done. This is one of those tragedies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the region around Harmony, Ind., few local </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> agencies have the money for crisis-intervention training, said attorney Craig McKee, who represents the Clay County </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sheriff's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Office. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deputies</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who responded to Gary Page's call had not received such training, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They need help from professionals to prepare them for this,&quot; McKee said. &quot;Society is not necessarily handling mental health issues well, so the number of encounters like this is escalating.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Clay County </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sheriff</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Paul Harden said he is not sure any amount of training would have helped his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deputies</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I know wants to be involved in an incident like this,&quot; Harden said in a written statement. &quot;Even when I am confident that we handled the situation the right way, as I do here, it can't help but shake people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Family members still wipe away tears when discussing Page's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But his sister-in-law, Nyla Young, said they do not blame </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I pray every night for the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who had to make that decision, because they didn't go to work that day and want to have to make that decision,&quot; Young said. &quot;Gary made them make that decision. Gary wanted to die. And Gary got what he wanted that day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Page, who was white, married Young's sister Hester in 1997, and the two were inseparable, she said. When Hester got sick about six years ago, Page became her primary caregiver. He had stopped working after securing disability payments for a back injury. So he was able to take her to doctor's appointments, bathe and dress her, and carry her from their bed to their living room to watch TV.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In February, Hester slipped into a coma  and died. Her </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> crushed Page, Young said. He had vowed to keep her alive and had devoted years to that mission. Now, he was alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A week before the shooting, Page called Young and asked her to pick up her sister's ashes, a move she now regrets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;That was probably the final straw,&quot; Young said. &quot;He wasn't taking care of her ashes any longer, so he had nothing left to live for.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Page lived in the Pines Apartments, downstairs from his stepdaughter. With </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on the way, a neighbor unaware of the unfolding drama emerged from her apartment and asked Page to quiet down, according to a detailed account of the shooting prepared by a local prosecutor, who cleared the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deputies</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of wrongdoing. Page took the woman hostage and waited for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Three </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deputies</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> soon arrived. One approached through the front door and ordered Page to drop his weapon. The enraged man continued to scream at his hostage. Then Page spotted two more </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deputies</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> approaching through the back door.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Don't do it. . . . I'll shoot!&quot; he shouted and raised his gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brian Helmer, who had been with the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">sheriff's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> department for less than two years, fired twice. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deputy</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who had come in through the front, Joshua Clarke, heard the gunfire and shot six times more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Page lay bleeding, Helmer and Clarke quickly transitioned into rescue mode. In a scene captured by a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> body camera, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> secured Page's weapon, realizing for the first time that it was not loaded with real bullets. They tore off his sweatpants and used them to stanch the blood pouring from a wound in his chest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Page stopped breathing, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> performed CPR. A bystander urged them to let Page die, according to the prosecutor's report. Instead, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> asked for Page's first name and spoke to him as they pumped his chest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moments later, paramedics arrived. In the video's final seconds, Helmer walked away from Page's body, breathing heavily and sobbing. Then the video ends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gary Page was dead.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an alley in Denver, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> gunned down a 17-year-old girl joyriding in a stolen car. In the backwoods of North Carolina, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> opened fire on a gun-wielding moonshiner. And in a high-rise apartment in Birmingham, Ala., </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shot an elderly man after his son asked them to make sure he was okay. Douglas Harris, 77, answered the door with a gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three are among at least 385 people shot and killed by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> nationwide during the first five months of this year, more than two a day, according to a Washington Post analysis. That is more than twice the rate of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">fatal</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shootings tallied by the federal government over the past decade, a count that officials concede is incomplete.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These shootings are grossly underreported,&quot; said Jim Bueermann, a former </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> chief and president of the Washington-based </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Foundation, a nonprofit organization dedicated to improving law enforcement. &quot;We are never going to reduce the number of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shootings if we don't begin to accurately track this information.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A national debate is raging about </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> use of deadly force, especially against minorities. To understand why and how often these shootings occur, The Washington Post is compiling a database of every </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">fatal</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shooting by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in 2015, as well as of every </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> killed by gunfire in the line of duty. The Post looked exclusively at shootings, not killings by other means, such as stun guns and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deaths</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> custody.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Using interviews, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> reports, local news accounts and other sources, The Post tracked more than a dozen details about each killing through Friday, including the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">victim's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> race, whether the person was </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the circumstances that led to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">fatal</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> encounter. The result is an unprecedented examination of these shootings, many of which began as minor incidents and suddenly escalated into violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among The Post's findings:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">l About half the victims were white, half minority. But the demographics shifted sharply among the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unarmed</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">victims,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> two-thirds of whom were black or Hispanic. Overall, blacks were killed at three times the rate of whites or other minorities when adjusting by the population of the census tracts where the shootings occurred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">l The vast majority of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">victims</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - more than 80 percent - were </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with potentially lethal objects, primarily guns, but also knives, machetes, revving vehicles and, in one case, a nail gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">l Forty-nine people had no weapon, while the guns wielded by 13 others turned out to be toys. In all, 16 percent were either carrying a toy or were unarmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">l The dead ranged in age from 16 to 83. Eight were children younger than 18, including Jessie Hernandez, 17, who was shot three times by Denver </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as she and a carload of friends allegedly tried to run them down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Post analysis also sheds light on the situations that most commonly gave rise to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">fatal</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shootings. About half of the time, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were responding to people seeking help with domestic disturbances and other complex social situations: A homeless person behaving erratically. A boyfriend threatening violence. A son trying to kill himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ninety-two victims - nearly a quarter of those killed - were identified by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or family members as mentally ill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Miami Gardens, Fla., Catherine Daniels called 911 when she couldn't persuade her son, Lavall Hall, a 25-year-old black man, to come in out of the cold early one morning in February. A diagnosed schizophrenic who stood 5-foot-4 and weighed barely 120 pounds, Hall was wearing boxer shorts and an undershirt and waving a broomstick when </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> arrived. They tried to stun him with a Taser gun and then shot him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other half of shootings involved non-domestic crimes, such as robberies, or the routine duties that occupy patrol </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> such as serving warrants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nicholas T. Thomas, a 23-year-old black man, was killed in March when </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Smyrna, Ga., tried to serve him with a warrant for failing to pay $170 in felony probation fees. Thomas fled the Goodyear tire shop where he worked as a mechanic, and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shot into his car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although race was a dividing line, those who died by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> gunfire often had much in common. Most were poor and had a history of run-ins with law enforcement over mostly small-time crimes, sometimes because they were emotionally troubled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both things were true of Daniel Elrod, a 39-year-old white man. Elrod had been arrested at least 16 times over the past 15 years; he was taken into protective custody twice last year because Omaha </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> feared he might hurt himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the day he died in February, Elrod robbed a Family Dollar store. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said he ran when </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> arrived, jumping on top of a BMW in the parking lot and yelling, &quot;Shoot me, shoot me.&quot; Elrod, who was unarmed, was shot three times as he made a &quot;mid-air leap&quot; to clear a barbed-wire fence, according to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> records.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dozens of other people also died while fleeing from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Post analysis shows, including a significant proportion - 20 percent - of those who were unarmed. Running is such a provocative act that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> experts say there is a name for the injury </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> inflict on suspects afterward: a &quot;foot tax.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are authorized to use deadly force only when they fear for their lives or the lives of others. So far, just three of the 385 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">fatal</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shootings have resulted in an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> being charged with a crime - less than 1 percent. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The low rate mirrors the findings of a Post investigation in April that found that of thousands of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">fatal</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shootings over the past decade, only 54 had produced criminal charges. Typically, those cases involved layers of damning evidence challenging the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> account. Of the cases resolved, most </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were cleared or acquitted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In all three 2015 cases in which charges were filed, videos emerged showing the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shooting a suspect during or after a foot chase:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">l In South Carolina, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Michael Slager was charged with murder in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of Walter Scott, a 50-year-old black man, who ran after a traffic stop. Slager's attorney declined to comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">l In Oklahoma, reserve </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deputy</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Robert Bates was charged with second-degree manslaughter 10 days after he killed Eric Harris, a 44-year-old black man. Bates's attorney, Clark Brewster, characterized the shooting as a &quot;legitimate accident,&quot; noting that Bates mistakenly grabbed his gun instead of his Taser.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">l And in Pennsylvania, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lisa Mearkle was charged with criminal homicide six weeks after she shot and killed David Kassick, a 59-year-old white man, who refused to pull over for a traffic stop. Her attorney did not return calls for comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In many other cases, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> agencies have determined that the shootings were justified. But many law enforcement leaders are calling for greater scrutiny.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After nearly a year of protests against </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> brutality and with a White House task force report calling for reforms, a dozen current and former </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> chiefs and other criminal justice officials said </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> must begin to accept responsibility for the carnage. They argue that a large number of the killings examined by The Post could be blamed on poor policing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have to get beyond what is legal and start focusing on what is preventable. Most are preventable,&quot; said Ronald L. Davis, a former </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> chief who heads the Justice Department's Office of Community Oriented Policing Services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;need to stop chasing down suspects, hopping fences and landing on top of someone with a gun,&quot; Davis said. &quot;When they do that, they have no choice but to shoot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a start, criminologists say the federal government should systematically analyze </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shootings. Currently, the FBI struggles to gather the most basic data. Reporting is voluntary, and since 2011, less than 3 percent of the nation's 18,000 state and local </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> agencies have reported </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">fatal</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shootings by their </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to the FBI. As a result, FBI records over the past decade show only about 400 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shootings a year - an average of 1.1 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deaths</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> per day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to The Post's analysis, the daily </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> toll so far for 2015 is close to 2.6. At that pace, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will have shot and killed nearly 1,000 people by the end of the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have to understand the phenomena behind these </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">fatal</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> encounters,&quot; Bueermann said. &quot;There is a compelling social need for this, but a lack of political will to make it happen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the vast majority of departments, a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">fatal</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shooting is a rare event. Only 306 agencies have recorded one so far this year, and most had only one, the Post analysis shows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, 19 state and local departments were involved in at least three </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">fatal</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shootings. Los Angeles </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> lead the nation with eight. The latest occurred May 5, when Brendon Glenn, a 29-year-old homeless black man, was shot after an altercation outside a Venice bar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oklahoma City </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have killed four people, including an 83-year-old white man wielding a machete.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want to do the most we can to keep from taking someone's life, even under the worst circumstances,&quot; said Oklahoma City </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chief William Citty. &quot;There are just going to be some shootings that are unavoidable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Bakersfield, Calif., all three of the department's killings occurred in a span of 10 days in March. The most recent involved Adrian Hernandez, a 22-year-old Hispanic man accused of raping his roommate, dousing her with flammable liquid and setting fire to their home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a manhunt, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cornered Hernandez, who jumped out of his car holding a BB gun. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> opened fire, and some Bakersfield residents say they are glad the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm relieved he can't come back here, to be honest with you,&quot; said Brian Haver, who lives next door to the house Hernandez torched. &quot;If he came out holding a gun, what were they supposed to do?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although law enforcement officials say many shootings are preventable, that is not always true. In dozens of cases, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rushed into volatile situations and saved lives. Examples of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> heroism abound.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Tempe, Ariz., </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rescued a 25-year-old woman who had been stabbed and tied up and was screaming for help. Her boyfriend, Matthew Metz, a 26-year-old white man, also stabbed an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> before he was shot and killed, according to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> records.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In San Antonio, a patrol </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> heard gunshots and rushed to the parking lot of Dad's Karaoke bar to find a man shooting into the crowd. Richard Castilleja, a 29-year-old Latino, had hit two men and was still unloading his weapon when he was shot and killed, according to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> records.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And in Los Angeles County, a Hawthorne </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> working overtime was credited with saving the life of a 12-year-old boy after a frantic woman in a gray Mercedes pulled alongside the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and said three men in a white Cadillac were following her and her son.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seconds later, the Cadillac roared up. Robert Washington, a 37-year-old black man, jumped out and began shooting into the woman's car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He had two revolvers and started shooting both of them with no words spoken. He shot and killed the mom, and then he started shooting at the kid,&quot; said Eddie Aguirre, a Los Angeles County homicide detective investigating the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deputy</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> got out of his patrol car and started shooting,&quot; Aguirre said. &quot;He saved the boy's life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In about half the shootings, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were responding to non-domestic criminal situations, with robberies and traffic infractions ranking among the most common offenses. Nearly half of blacks and other minorities were killed under such circumstances. So were about a third of whites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In North Carolina, a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> searching for clues in a hit-and-run case approached a green and white mobile home owned by Lester Brown, a 58-year-old white man. On the front porch, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> spotted an illegal liquor still. He called for backup, and drug agents soon arrived with a search warrant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> knocked on the door and asked Brown to secure his dog. Instead, Brown dashed upstairs and grabbed a Soviet SKS rifle, according to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neighbor Joe Guffey Jr. told a local TV reporter that he was sitting at home with his dogs when the shooting started: &quot;Pow, pow, pow, pow.&quot; Brown was hit seven times and pronounced dead at the scene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Brown allegedly stood his ground, many others involved in criminal activity chose to flee when confronted by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kassick, for example, attracted Mearkle's attention because he had expired vehicle inspection stickers. On the day he died, Kassick was on felony probation for drunken driving and had drugs in his system, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and autopsy reports show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After failing to pull over, Kassick drove to his sister's house in Hummelstown, Pa., jumped out of the car and ran. Mearkle repeatedly struck Kassick with a stun gun and then shot him twice in the back while he was face-down in the snow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Ray Robinson, a.k.a. the &quot;Honey Bun Bandit,&quot; allegedly robbed five convenience stores in Central Texas, grabbing some of the sticky pastries along the way. Robinson, a 51-year-old black man, fled when he spotted Waco </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> staking out his home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robinson sped off in reverse in a green Ford Explorer. It got stuck in the mud, and four Waco </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> opened fire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They think they can outrun the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They don't realize how dangerous it is,&quot; said Samuel Lee Reid, executive director of the Atlanta Citizen Review Board, which investigates </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shootings and recently launched a &quot;Don't Run&quot; campaign. &quot;The panic sets in,&quot; and &quot;all they can think is that they don't want to get caught and go back to jail.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most troubling cases began with a cry for help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About half the shootings occurred after family members, neighbors or strangers sought help from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> because someone was suicidal, behaving erratically or threatening violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Take Shane Watkins, a 39-year-old white man, who died in his mother's driveway in Moulton, Ala.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Watkins had never been violent, and family members were not afraid for their safety when they called Lawrence County </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">sheriff's deputies</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in March. But Watkins, who suffered from bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, was off his medication. Days earlier, he had declared himself the &quot;god of the fifth element&quot; and demanded whiskey and beer so he could &quot;cleanse the earth with it,&quot; said his sister, Yvonne Cote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then he started threatening to shoot himself and his dog, Slayer. His mother called Cote, who called 911. Cote got back on the phone with her mother, who watched Watkins walk onto the driveway holding a box cutter to his chest. A patrol car pulled up, and Cote heard her mother yell: &quot;Don't shoot! He doesn't have a gun!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Then I heard the gunshots,&quot; Cote said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawrence County </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">sheriff's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> officials declined to comment and have refused to release documents related to the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are so many unanswered questions,&quot; she said. &quot;All he had was a box cutter. Wasn't there some other way for them to handle this?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Catherine Daniels called </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for the same reason. &quot;I wanted to get my son help,&quot; she said. Instead, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Peter Ehrlich and Eddo Trimino fired their stun guns after Hall hit them with the metal end of the broomstick, according to investigative documents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Please don't hurt my child,&quot; Daniels pleaded, in a scene captured by a camera mounted on the dash of one of the patrol cars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Get on the f---ing ground or you're dead!&quot; Trimino shouted. Then he fired five shots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> spokesman Mike Wright declined to comment on the case. Daniels said no one from the city has contacted her. &quot;I haven't received anything. No apology, nothing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But hours after her son was killed, Daniels said, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> investigating the shooting dropped off a six-pack of Coca-Cola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I regret calling them,&quot; Daniels said. &quot;They took my son's life.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As part of an ongoing examination of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> accountability, The Washington Post has attempted to track every </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">fatal</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shooting by law enforcement nationwide since January, as well as the number of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who were fatally shot in the line of duty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Post compiled the data using news reports, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> records, open sources on the Internet and other original reporting. Several organizations, including Killed by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police and  Fatal</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Encounters, have been collecting information about people who die during encounters with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Post documented only those incidents in which a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, while on duty, shot and killed a civilian. Cases in which </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were shot to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were also tabulated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To comprehensively examine the issue, a database was compiled with information about each incident, including the deceased's age, race, gender, location and general circumstances. The Post also noted whether </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> reported that the person was armed and, if so, with what type of weapon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FBI and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention log </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">fatal</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shootings, but the data the two federal agencies gather is incomplete. The Post analyzed a decade of FBI and CDC records as part of the study.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To examine racial and economic patterns, The Post identified the location of every </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">fatal</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shooting and compared it with the composition of the surrounding census tract.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The data, which will be collected through the end of the year, will be made public at a future date.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don't confuse the Department of Justice with the cavalry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When it comes to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> department reform, &quot;Too many community activists think the Justice Department is going to save us,&quot; said Samuel Walker, a professor emeritus at the University of Nebraska who has written extensively on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> accountability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unofficial reports that Palm Beach County </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sheriff's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Office shootings had drawn DOJ's attention began surfacing days after The Palm Beach Post and WPTV NewsChannel 5 published a series detailing 15 years of shootings. Last week, Palm Beach County </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sheriff</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ric Bradshaw said the FBI is investigating a single, as-yet unidentified PBSO incident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Federal intervention could lead to sweeping changes in long-established </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> practice. However, getting that kind of formal attention is as difficult as it is rare.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">True, there are plenty of recent DOJ interventions: In 2011, it investigated </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> departments in Miami and New Orleans; in 2013, Cleveland; in 2014 Ferguson, Mo.; and, last week, the department officially opened a civil rights investigation into the Baltimore </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Department, after riots followed a man's in-custody </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In every case, DOJ was seen as the last, best hope for policing the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But for two decades, the special civil rights section handling investigations has been buffeted by politics and hamstrung by scant resources. And some departments, including the Miami </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Department, revert to poor or even lethal policing as soon as DOJ leaves town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Question of resources</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besieged with hundreds of requests for help every year from advocacy groups, community leaders, lawyers, city councils, mayors and even </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> chiefs, DOJ's civil rights section is simply too small for the task, said Walker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You have 18,000 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> departments, a lot of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> misconduct and extremely limited resources,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They couldn't possibly do it all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For instance, when Michael Brown was shot by a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Ferguson last August, prompting riots, looting and national outrage, DOJ opened an investigation into the Ferguson </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> department. Officials went through 35,000 pages of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> records and thousands of emails. They brought in statistical experts to analyze traffic stops, searches, citations, and arrests. They pored over court fees and municipal budgets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That was just one tiny </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> department: 54 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's roughly the same number of lawyers in the entire DOJ section responsible for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> department cases, according to a recent study into DOJ investigations by The Marshall Project, a nonprofit advocacy group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That helps explain why, since Congress first gave DOJ authority to investigate </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> department misconduct in 1994, the agency has averaged just three investigations a year, said Stephen Rushin, a visiting professor of law at the University of Illinois and an expert on DOJ investigations of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> misconduct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Why us?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why DOJ picks one </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> department over another can be baffling. When DOJ announced it would investigate Steubenville, Ohio, in 1996, the city manager protested, &quot;Why us? Why a small town instead of Chicago?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's no clear answer, for instance, as to why the FBI would show interest in Palm Beach County and not Chicago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And DOJ may want it that way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is no checklist that says, 'If I do these things, I am going to fall into the investigation bucket, and if I do these other things, I am going to fall outside the investigation bucket,'&quot; DOJ special litigation chief Jonathan Smith said in a 2013 meeting with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> chiefs from throughout the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Keeping </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> departments guessing can be a useful tool, Rushin suggested. After all, the prospect of winning DOJ's &quot;terrible lottery&quot; might prompt reforms just to keep the agency away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, said Walker, after 20 years of DOJ settlements, every </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> department in the country already has a road map for DOJ-blessed reforms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bradshaw, for instance, examined DOJ reviews in Albuquerque, N.M., and elsewhere to develop policies on shootings. It's one reason he insists any federal investigation will confirm that PBSO is far ahead of the curve when it comes to what DOJ wants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't care if they come in here or not,&quot; said Bradshaw last year. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">sheriff</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> made his comments shortly after attorney Jack Scarola, who represents a bicyclist shot and paralyzed by a PBSO </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deputy</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in 2013, wrote then-Attorney General Eric Holder and asked that DOJ investigate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would be very confident that if they looked at our policies, they looked at our procedures, they looked at how we investigate these things, we're going to be so far ahead of everybody else, you have no idea,&quot; Bradshaw said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Problems elsewhere</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But DOJ has faulted departments in other cities for certain types of shootings that also occurred in Palm Beach County: shooting </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unarmed</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or mentally ill </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">suspects</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, shootings in which larger-than-expected numbers of victims are racial or ethnic minorities and a record of rarely faulting a law enforcement </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> actions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In three </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">fatal</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> PBSO shootings since 2010, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">suspects</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> weren't </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Further, roughly one in every four PBSO shootings since 2000, including those that did not injure or kill a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">suspect</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, also involved </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unarmed</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">suspects</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, a figure higher than at least two cities DOJ has criticized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also in the past five years, a 17-year-old with Down syndrome and a mentally ill man who was not competent to stand trial were shot. A diagnosed schizophrenic was shot and killed. So was a teenager with serious mental illnesses who was throwing rocks at a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deputy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since 2000, PBSO has ruled all but one of 45 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">fatal</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shootings were justified. Since 2010, every PBSO shooting was ruled justified, a 100 percent clearance rate. By contrast, DOJ found Miami's 87 percent clearance rate unrealistically high.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deputies</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have disproportionately shot at black people, particularly young men. Although African-Americans make up 15 percent of people living in the area PBSO patrols, they represent 35 percent of those shot at by PBSO. One in three was unarmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political winds</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No single questionable shooting, or even several shootings, automatically means DOJ will come knocking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For one thing, the number of investigations and settlements closely tracks who occupies the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the Bill Clinton era, when legislation enabling investigations passed in the wake of the Rodney King beating, DOJ promptly opened a handful of cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President George W. Bush, on the other hand, expressed reluctance to become involved in local law enforcement issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Policies and priorities are expected to shift with administrations. However, in the Bush years, a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deputy</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> assistant attorney general overseeing the DOJ division handling </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> investigations went beyond policy shifts, according to a DOJ inspector general inquiry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report concluded Bradley Schlozman weeded out or refused to hire attorneys not affiliated with Republicans or conservative groups, and expressed a desire to avoid attorneys involved in &quot;some crazy liberal organization ... I just want to make sure we don't start confining ourselves to, you know, Politburo members because they happen to be a member of some, you know, psychopathic left-wing organization.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, another assistant attorney general interviewed by the inspector general said Schlozman wasn't doing anything out of the ordinary: Under Clinton, he said, there was a virtual ban on hiring conservatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schlozman served between 2003 and 2006. Between 2004 and 2008, new investigations of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> departments dropped sharply. Not one reform agreement with a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> department was finalized, and many investigations simply were closed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Barack Obama was elected, DOJ priorities changed again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eric Holder ramped up the number of investigations, picking up speed as Obama neared reelection: 15 new investigations or major settlements in the past three years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Repeat offenders</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, charges against individuals are rarely open and shut: No charges against a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were brought in the Michael Brown shooting, for instance, which triggered the Ferguson unrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And when DOJ investigates a department, there's no guarantee reforms will stick.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Take Miami. After 13 Miami </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were indicted for conspiring to block an investigation into </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shootings, DOJ in 2002 launched its first investigation at the request of then-Mayor Joe Carollo and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chief Raul Martinez.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miami pledged voluntary changes, including stronger policies, better training and thorough investigations into shootings as well as other uses of force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For 20 months, not a single </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> fired a gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By 2006, after that period ended, DOJ became alarmed at how </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were using force on suspects, including lethal force. It sent a letter to the department, and Miami agreed to restrict shootings and better investigate them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then DOJ withdrew.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shootings began again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Between 2008 and 2011, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shot at civilians 33 times. In a matter of months, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> killed six young African-American men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In February 2011, Travis McNeil became the seventh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reaching for cellphone</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McNeil and his cousin, Kareem Williams, were pulled over after leaving a bar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a high-powered traffic stop: Miami </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and federal agents had been combing the streets as part of a joint effort to arrest gang members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three unmarked cars drew up to McNeil's Kia Sorrento, effectively boxing him in. Miami </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reynaldo Goyos drew his gun, got within a foot of McNeil's open window and fired three shots, killing him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McNeil had ducked toward the floorboard, Goyos said later, and could have been reaching for a gun. There was no gun, only two cellphones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were other incidents. One </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> fired because a motorist was reaching for his wallet after he had been told to provide identification. At other times, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> literally could not shoot straight: Bullets aimed at suspects were found lodged in the homes and cars of bystanders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2011, DOJ opened its second investigation in 12 years, concluding that it was time for &quot;court-enforceable&quot; remedies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another way?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Las Vegas tried a different tack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2011, two weeks after The Las Vegas Review-Journal reported many </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shootings of suspects could have been avoided, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shot and killed an unarmed, mentally ill Gulf War veteran.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A hail of criticism followed. But instead of an investigation by DOJ's special litigation section, DOJ's Community Oriented Policing Services division led a review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The COPS division has no legal authority to enforce its recommendations, a fact that led some critics to doubt its effectiveness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the process was praised as faster, cheaper and more cooperative, thus generating change more quickly. And three years after the COPS report was published, there's evidence that it worked, said William Sousa, director of the University of Nevada's Center for Crime and Justice Policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number of shootings by Las Vegas Metro </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Department </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> overall is down, he said, and when shootings do occur, the circumstances are more understandable -- almost all of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">suspects</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have been </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regardless of which DOJ division intervenes, reforms can work, Sousa said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And regardless of whether DOJ is investigating a single shooting, such as in Palm Beach County, or an entire department, he said law enforcement officials will want to take their concerns seriously: &quot;The federal government doesn't usually have an interest in investing resources in areas where they don't have a great chance of winning.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What you need to know</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">~HOA~128~128~ While some see the U.S. Department of Justice as the ultimate authority over local </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> departments, it's rare for the feds to get involved, and, even when they do, their reforms can lead to little change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">~HOA~128~128~ Further, DOJ investigations are political and depend on who is occupying the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">~HOA~128~128~ Still, DOJ has left a litany of reforms over 20 years, a blueprint Palm Beach County </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sheriff</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ric Bradshaw says he considers, even as his agency has justified 44 of 45 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">fatal</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shootings since 2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the Justice Department comes knocking</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three DOJ approaches:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">~HOA~128~128~ Investigates entire departments to determine whether a &quot;pattern or practice&quot; of civil rights violations exists. May impose reforms and force cities to pay for monitoring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">~HOA~128~128~ Investigates individual </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, including those who shot </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unarmed</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">suspects</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, to determine whether they used &quot;objectively unreasonable force.&quot; May bring criminal charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">~HOA~128~128~ Sends in Community Oriented Policing Services division to investigate or oversee investigation of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> departments. Makes nonbinding recommendations for reform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHAT THE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PROBE FOUND</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Post and NewsChannel 5 found that the Palm Beach County </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sheriff's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Office has cleared 97 percent of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">fatal</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shootings since 2000 and that evidence is ignored in the investigations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 23-year-old baby sitter who forced a child to perform a sexual act on him in 2012 was convicted and faces a mandatory life sentence in prison, according to the State Attorney's Office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brandon Jerome Fleming was found guilty of sexual battery Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fleming forced a 6-year-old child to perform a sexual act on him while he was baby-sitting in 2012, prosecutors said. The child later told her mother and she contacted authorities.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An adult in an automated wheelchair was taken to a hospital in life-threatening condition after being struck by a tractor-trailer Thursday night in Jacksonville.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> responded to the 5900 block of New Kings Road about 8:30 p.m. after the crash was reported and the pedestrian was taken to UF Health Jacksonville in life-threatening condition, Lt. M.T. Mahaffay said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the pedestrian was in the northbound lanes of New Kings in an area without a crosswalk near Edgewood Avenue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The driver of the tractor-trailer remained at the scene and is cooperating with the investigation, Mahaffay said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A dispute over a change in party plans led to the slaying of a Jacksonville woman, whose boyfriend was charged Thursday with murder, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said in releasing new details Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Calvin Tyrone Andrews Jr., 36, is charged with murder in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of LaBreka Brittany Evans, 29. Both lived in a home in the 2500 block of Woodland Street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andrews was initially charged with aggravated domestic battery after Evans was shot in the chest April 26. She was shot at their home off Moncrief Road after the couple began arguing and pushing and shoving over a change in a party they were planning, said Assistant Chief Chris Butler.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andrews initially told a neighbor Evans shot herself before driving her to the hospital. The neighbor told </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that Evans was heard saying, &quot;Help me, don't let him take me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A witness took possession of children, ages 6 and 10, at the home. Evans was their mother, while Andrews is the father of one of the children, Butler said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Evans was listed in life-threatening condition and died two days later. Butler said </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> investigated domestic incidents involving the couple in 2008 and 2012.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 62-year-old Baker County man who barricaded himself in a home Friday after firing shots at his wife was found dead inside when authorities entered, according to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sheriff's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The call came about 1:30 p.m. after the man fired shots at his wife as she left the home on Florida 121 in a vehicle, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sheriff</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Joey Dobson said. She was not injured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dobson said the special response team surrounded the home and filled it with gas to try to get the man to come out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When that didn't work, members of the team entered the home about 5:50 p.m. and found the man dead from a gunshot wound, Dobson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man's identity has not been released.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 55-year-old Orange Park man who was first arrested in December on child-pornography charges was charged Thursday with 27 counts of video voyeurism, according to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gary Dean Newton is in the Clay County jail on $540,000 bail, according to the Department of Law Enforcement. He will be transferred to the Duval County jail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Newton was initially arrested after videos of child pornography were found during a search warrant at his home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Agents located evidence of video voyeurism involving numerous victims during that investigation, which led to the additional charges Thursday, according to the FDLE. Further details were not provided.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Authorities in Columbia County responded to Annie Mattox Park on March 31 after three people were shot, according to the Lake City </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Department. Two of the victims survived, but 16-year-old Travarious Claridy died several days later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 16-year-old turned himself in after three arrest warrants were issued, then Bennie L. Jordan, 40, did the same Tuesday after media reported he had a warrant for his arrest, according to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ronyeah R. Wright, 19, was the third suspect and was thought to be in Jacksonville but showed up for Columbia County authorities Thursday night.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yelizaveta Horton was in a Saturn at a stop sign in the northbound lanes of Smith Trail at Sesame Boulevard when she drove into the path of a Chrysler Town &amp; Country about 10 a.m., according to the Highway Patrol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robin Best, 58, was driving east in the Chrysler and hit the side of the Saturn, the FHP said. An 8-year-old and a 2-year-old were in the Chrysler. All three in the van suffered minor injuries.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 34-year-old East Palatka man was zapped with a Taser, then arrested late Thursday after an armed standoff with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deputies</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Bangor Avenue, according to the Putnam County </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sheriff's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Timothy Paul Anderson was charged with shooting a firearm within a private residence and two counts of possession of a firearm by a felon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The standoff began about 9 p.m. after a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deputy</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was dispatched to a home when a 911 caller hung up abruptly, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sheriff's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Office said. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deputy</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> met with Anderson's mother, who said her son had a handgun and had threatened to shoot himself. She said he had earlier fired one shot inside another occupied home and that she had been cut when the bullet shattered a floor tile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The woman said her son now had a shotgun and was inside a house on Bangor Avenue with his 81-year-old grandmother.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Deputies</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> surrounded the house, and Anderson came out armed with a large knife, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sheriff's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Office said.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">STUDENT ARRESTED AFTER GUN FOUND IN CAR</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Creekside High School student in St. Johns County has been suspended for 10 days and arrested after a loaded .38-caliber handgun was found in his sport-utility vehicle at school Thursday afternoon, according to Times-Union news partner First Coast News.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Griffin Scott Hudgins, 18, was charged with possession of a firearm on school property. That's after a K-9 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> dog alerted authorities to his Ford Explorer during a sniff check in the parking lot, and the Smith and Wesson revolver, loaded with five rounds, was found in the trunk, according to the St. Johns County </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sheriff's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The student was automatically suspended and will go before the county school district's discipline committee to determine whether further punishment is warranted, district spokeswoman Christina Langston said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hudgins told school staff at the scene that he knew the gun was inside the vehicle, according to an arrest report. Also found inside the vehicle was a retractable metal baton, according to the report.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">By Doug Donovan and Jean Marbella, The Baltimore Sun</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7"> BODY:<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marleta House struggled for years to stop hating the Baltimore </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who shot and killed her husband in 1999 after mistaking his cellphone for a gun. &quot;I don't hate him now,&quot; said House, who lives in Dundalk. &quot;He has to answer to a higher power.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the 45-year-old MTA bus driver remains just as frustrated today that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Christopher Graul was not charged and that Baltimore prosecutors never bothered to tell her why.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most families do not see </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> charged and tried in a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> resulting from an encounter with city </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In fact, before State's Attorney Marilyn J. Mosby charged six </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of Freddie Gray, just five city </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> during the past three decades have faced criminal prosecution for on-duty actions that resulted in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> according to interviews with experts, news reports, government data and court records. One was found guilty; the verdict was overturned on appeal.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While officials acknowledge that there is no comprehensive historical data on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-involved </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deaths,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the period since 2006 provides a telling sample. Sixty-seven people died in encounters with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> over that period, according to the Baltimore </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Department, and two </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> faced criminal charges in those incidents. One, who was on duty when a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">fatal</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shooting took place, was acquitted. Another, who was off duty at a nightclub, was convicted and sentenced to 15 years in a separate shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That illustrates the high bar Mosby faces as she seeks to turn her charges into convictions. Four </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the Gray case face charges that range from involuntary manslaughter to second-degree-murder; the two others face lesser charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's very difficult to get verdicts against the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; said A. Dwight Pettit, an attorney who has filed dozens of civil lawsuits alleging </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> brutality, including one he lost involving the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of House's husband. &quot;People do not want to believe -- before the advent of cameras and cellphones -- that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would do that type of malicious conduct.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">House and other relatives of those who died in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> encounters hope Mosby's prosecution and a federal investigation of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Department will help change a prosecutorial process that they say favors </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and fosters further brutality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With the Freddie Gray case, at least someone can have justice,&quot; House said. &quot;They will never have closure. It's just a sad situation. You're leaving kids without fathers, wives without husbands, mothers without sons. With no answers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Policing experts say the reason Baltimore </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> avoid charges is clear: They are frequently thrust into dangerous situations in one of the nation's most violent cities and must protect themselves, their partners and others in the vicinity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As horrible as it is, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> can do it right by the book and someone may tragically lose their life,&quot; said Bill Johnson, executive director of the National Association of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Organizations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> involved in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deaths</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are intensely scrutinized -- by internal affairs units, prosecutors, the news media, lawyers, civilian review boards and, sometimes, federal investigators, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think it's correct for people to say that these things get swept under the carpet,&quot; Johnson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mosby and predecessors Gregg L. Bernstein and Patricia C. Jessamy declined to comment for this article, as did the Baltimore </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Department and the Fraternal Order of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lodge 3.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But other prosecutors say the decision to charge an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> must follow the evidence, not public passions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's no big conspiracy not to convict </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,&quot; said Melba V. Pearson, president of the National Black Prosecutors Association. &quot;I cannot file cases that I cannot prove.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Mosby has been praised for charging the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> involved in the April 12 arrest of Gray -- who died a week later from spinal injuries sustained in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> custody -- some legal experts say she brought charges to quell Baltimore's civil unrest rather than to seek justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is a tragedy, but not every </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is a murder or a crime,&quot; said Jason Weinstein, a criminal defense attorney and former federal prosecutor in Maryland who won a public corruption conviction against former Baltimore </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Commissioner Edward Norris in 2004. &quot;Whether you have a badge or not, if there is sufficient evidence that you engaged in illegal conduct, you should be prosecuted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But if there's not sufficient evidence, then you shouldn't be prosecuted. That should be the only question. It shouldn't be how much coverage there is on CNN or if there were riots.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The city's rare cases</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The last Baltimore </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> charged with an on-duty killing was Tommy Sanders in 2008. Sanders shot an unarmed 27-year-old in the back as the man fled from the Hamilton Park Shopping Center. A jury acquitted Sanders of manslaughter after he said the man, Edward Lamont Hunt, reached into a pocket, making him fear for his life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Years earlier, Stephen Pagotto was charged with manslaughter in the 1996 shooting </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of a 22-year-old man during a traffic stop in Northeast Baltimore. Pagotto was convicted, but the verdict was overturned on appeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pagotto said the shooting was an accident caused when his gun discharged accidentally, and the state's highest court ruled he was not criminally responsible. But the court noted that the sergeant violated departmental rules, which amounted to &quot;civil negligence,&quot; and the city paid $100,000 to settle a lawsuit filed by the family of the driver, Preston Barnes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In such settlements, the city and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> do not acknowledge liability for a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charges against three other </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deaths</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of suspects between 1983 and 1994 ended in a mistrial and two acquittals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only other </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to be convicted of manslaughter in the past 30 years was Gahiji Tshamba, who was off duty when he shot and killed Tyrone Brown in a fight outside a nightclub in 2010. He was sentenced to 15 years, and the city paid a settlement in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> because Brown's lawyer argued that Tshamba had claimed to be making an off-duty arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such cases, though, are exceptions. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rarely are charged, let alone convicted, in arrest-related </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deaths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But just how rare it is can be hard to quantify because not all law enforcement agencies keep track of the number of people killed in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> encounters, and there is some variability in the way states collect data. Over the three decades, at least 120 people have died in encounters with Baltimore </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> according to city statistics and news reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The federal Bureau of Justice Statistics concluded in March that its tally of arrest-related </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deaths</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> likely captures half, at best, of the actual number of incidents. Nationwide from 2003 to 2009, the most recent statistics available, 4,813 arrest-related </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deaths</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were reported to the agency. Nearly 3,000 of them were classified as homicides by law enforcement; others include people who committed suicide when an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> responded to a 911 call, or who sped away from a traffic stop and crashed. Detainees also have died from drug overdoses and other health problems while in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> custody.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A bill signed into law by Gov. Larry Hogan on Tuesday requires law enforcement agencies to report to the state the number of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-involved </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deaths,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as well as any </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> killed in the line of duty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Governor's Office of Crime Control and Prevention will start collecting the data in July and issue a report in October 2016 that will cover the three previous years, said Gregory Coster, who directs the office's Maryland Statistical Analysis Center. He said Maryland was already reporting </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deaths</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to the Bureau of Justice Statistics on a voluntary basis, but the new law makes it mandatory for local </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> departments to provide information to the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think any time you have a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> custody, it's something state and local government and the community needs to know about,&quot; said Christopher Shank, the former state senator who now directs the crime control office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I try to make him proud'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Shean D. Camper is among the rarities. A grand jury indicted him for manslaughter in the shooting </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of Jerrod D. Wagstaff, 25, in a dark alley off the 2700 block of Tivoly Ave. on May 6, 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm gone, man, I'm gone,&quot; Andre Flood, now 44, remembers his brother saying as he lay wounded that night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Flood and his mother returned this week to their former block, one of Baltimore's most notoriously criminal and tragic. After years of contending with the blight and drug trafficking in that part of Northeast Baltimore, the city in 2008 began leveling the block for a multimillion-dollar redevelopment project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But two bedraggled rowhouses remain on one stretch of the street: 2783, where the Floods lived, and 2781, where 10 people perished in a 1982 fire that remains among the most deadly in city history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I come down every once in a while just to look,&quot; Diane Flood said as a giant earth-moving machine rumbled over a pile of bricks a couple of lots down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The night of the shooting remains vivid to the Floods 21 years later: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> arrived to investigate reports of gunfire in the area, and Camper said Wagstaff began running, prompting a chase. Stories diverge at this point: Camper said the two scuffled, and he fired when Wagstaff took a threatening stance. Witnesses said Wagstaff was climbing over a fence when he was shot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The medical examiner's report said Wagstaff had puncture marks on his left hand from scaling the fence, and a bullet fired by Camper shattered against the fence, with a fragment striking Wagstaff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A witness at the time said she heard Wagstaff call for his mother, a medical assistant. But Andre Flood said </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> prevented her from getting to him and possibly rendering aid. Diane Flood said she rode in the ambulance with her unconscious son to Johns Hopkins Hospital, where a doctor she worked with was among those who tried to save him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Camper went to trial in March 1995 and was found not guilty. He and his attorney did not respond to requests for comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I felt as though he had gotten away with shooting my son,&quot; said Diane Flood, now retired. She filed a wrongful-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> suit against Camper, hoping that Wagstaff's son, then 2, would have money for college.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before that civil suit could come to trial, Camper, while off duty, was involved in a traffic dispute in which the other driver stopped, got out and struck him with a baseball bat. Camper shot and critically wounded the man, and the shooting was ruled justified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A jury ultimately awarded Wagstaff's family $111,000. The award was later revised, and Flood said that after lawyers' fees, she and her grandson each received about $33,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wagstaff's son, Brian Daniels, now 23, said his grandmother's wishes were fulfilled -- some of the settlement allowed him to attend community college and Morgan State University. He now works seven days a week -- Monday through Friday in help-desk support for TEKsystems, which was founded by Ravens owner Steve Bisciotti, and on weekends at a YMCA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No amount of money, though, can replace his loss, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't have a memory of my dad. I didn't have him at my games, at graduation, at birthday parties,&quot; said Daniels, who played football and lacrosse at Dunbar High School. &quot;But I try to make him proud.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Daniels credits his family, especially his grandmother Diane and uncle Andre, who is a truck driver and coach, with raising him to respect </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. And in fact, he said, he has applied to join the Anne Arundel </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 'difficult' standard</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The details of a 1994 incident are eerily familiar: A man is arrested in Sandtown-Winchester and placed in a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> transport van, where he is later found unconscious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said Jesse Chapman, 30, followed his girlfriend into the Western District </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> station late that night, where she'd gone to complain that he had beaten her. There, he tried to hit her, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said, and when </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tried to intervene, he ran. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> chased and caught him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> triggered days of protests, with more than 100 demonstrators converging on the Western District station at times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The medical examiner's office said Chapman's heart-lung system collapsed under stress from cocaine use, an asthma attack and a struggle with arresting </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and there was no evidence of repeated blows or significant injuries. A grand jury declined to indict the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While most </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who have been involved in arrest-related </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deaths</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> declined to comment for this article or did not respond to requests, one former </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> did defend his actions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charles M. Smothers shot a knife-wielding man outside Lexington Market in August 1997, an incident that was videotaped by a bystander and sparked community protests. But he rejected comparisons to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of Freddie Gray.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My case is totally different,&quot; Smothers said. &quot;I shot an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed suspect</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The videotape of the shooting showed four </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with their guns drawn approaching James Quarles III, who had been using a knife to open a package of socks he was hawking on the street. They ordered the 22-year-old, who was hunched with both hands close to the ground, to drop the knife, and when he failed to do so, Smothers shot him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then-state's attorney Jessamy decided not to present the case to a grand jury because she could &quot;find no evidence of a crime.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Smothers' career was changed anyway. As a result of the shooting, a previous domestic violence incident became more widely known and then-Commissioner Thomas C. Frazier fired him. Smothers had been charged with shooting at an ex-girlfriend and her new boyfriend in April 1995 -- the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said his gun went off accidentally -- and he received probation before judgment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, I did my job,&quot; said Smothers, who has joined the Fire Department. &quot;The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Department turned their back on me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are accused of shooting someone, they often testify that they feared for their life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's no accident. The Supreme Court case of Graham v. Connor established the reasonableness standard for judging </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who shoot people. Prosecutors and juries are required to consider the actions by putting themselves into the decisive moment when a gun was used, based on the specific facts and circumstances of each incident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> say they feared for their lives when they killed someone, it's hard to refute that assertion without other credible evidence, said Ron Hosko, a former assistant FBI director and president of the Law Enforcement Legal Defense Fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's for good reason, said Jim Pasco, executive director of the National Fraternal Order of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;What would seem to be the most routine of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> activities -- a traffic stop and a call for a domestic incident -- are ironically the most dangerous,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A New York City </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and two </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Mississippi died this month from gunshot wounds suffered in traffic stops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Often they come on a scene when an event is in progress, and they have to make a split-second decision about what action to take,&quot; Pasco said. &quot;These actions are subject to endless second-guessing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that frustrates attorneys like Pettit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's the boilerplate, standard defense: 'I thought I saw a gun, I thought my life was in jeopardy and I reacted,' &quot; he said. &quot;The Supreme Court doesn't allow you to second-guess the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and their other options. The law makes it very difficult to try these cases.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'An ugly situation'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critics say other factors add to the difficulty of bringing charges against </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who are involved in a suspect's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> often protect one another in such situations, said attorney William H. &quot;Billy&quot; Murphy Jr., who represents Gray's family. &quot;That's dishonorable. You have a nation that institutionally the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are believed over anybody black and over most citizens.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, Murphy said prosecutors struggle to bring charges against </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> they work with routinely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Philip Stinson, a criminologist at Bowling Green State University who has studied </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> misconduct cases, said it's always a challenge to convict </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nobody wants to see a cop go to prison,&quot; Stinson said. &quot;It's an ugly situation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he said the Gray case might be easier to win than a typical case of a questionable </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Juries are very reluctant to second-guess </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- especially in life-and-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> situations,&quot; he said. But in the Gray case, Stinson said, it would be difficult to convince a jury that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were in any danger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The facts are still not clear, said Hosko of the Law Enforcement Legal Defense Fund. While Mosby alleges that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ignored Gray's requests for medical care and placed him in a transport van without securing him in a seat belt -- violations of department policy -- Hosko notes that many detainees fake injuries to avoid going to jail. Some </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> do not place seat belts on suspects who are acting violently, he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mosby has a long way to go to prove that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had any criminal intent in how they treated Gray, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Hosko said it is possible that one or more </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Gray's arrest might deserve to be criminally charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Are there people who shouldn't be in law enforcement? Absolutely. Good leadership should run them off. But you have a lot of folks out there who got into law enforcement to be public servants and to ensure others' safety at their own risk,&quot; Hosko said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Tawanda Jones, whose brother died in a scuffle with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is among those encouraged by Mosby's stance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jones said a prosecutor's decision not to pursue charges in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of her brother Tyrone West drove her family to hold protests since he died on July 18, 2013.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state's attorney's office said that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were legally justified in using fists, batons and pepper spray to subdue West, who resisted arrest after a traffic stop. He died as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> pinned him on the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The medical examiner's office found that West died of a heart problem made worse by dehydration, the July heat and his struggle with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The autopsy report said West did not suffer any injuries that could have killed him, but the medical examiner could not determine whether the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> resulted from an accident, homicide or another means.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jones said then-state's attorney Bernstein did meet with the family to explain he would not be indicting any </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;He had the nerve to have us escorted out by a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She still is upset about Bernstein's decision, and recently voiced allegations of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> brutality to U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch during Lynch's Baltimore visit. The Justice Department later announced a broad civil rights investigation of Baltimore's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jones said Mosby has lived up to a campaign promise to prosecute </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for misconduct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm pleased that [Mosby] kept her word true to what she said she will do to handle </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> brutality,&quot; Jones said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Greta Carter-Willis -- who watched an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shoot and kill her 14-year-old son in her Southwest Baltimore rowhouse -- also is encouraged by Mosby's decision to charge the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Gray's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Aug. 12, 2006, Carter-Willis called </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to calm her son, Kevin Cooper, because the two were arguing. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said the boy was assaulting his mother, who has always denied that. After two </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> responded and calmed the boy, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Roderick Mitter stayed to write a report while the other </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> left.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said Mitter and the boy continued to argue, and the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sprayed him with Mace to no effect. The boy then hit Mitter with a broom handle, which broke, and came at the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with the jagged broken end, according to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That's when Mitter shot him in the shoulder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carter-Willis, 52, a retired state correctional </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> disputes the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> account. She says Mitter instigated the argument with her son, who was holding a dustpan when the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shot him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The boy, who had no criminal record, died that day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> declared the shooting &quot;justified&quot; by that afternoon, a decision that Carter-Willis says still baffles her. Mitter, who remains a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, did not respond to a request for comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pettit filed a lawsuit for wrongful </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> but the family lost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, Carter-Willis is closely watching the Gray case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mosby's action, she said, &quot;gives me hope that changes are taking place&quot; in how the justice system handles </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-involved </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deaths.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">May 22--A Sampson County </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">sheriff's deputy</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who shot and killed an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> robbery </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">suspect</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> last month was justified in his actions due to the apparent danger posed by the man, who wielded a shotgun as he approached the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deputies,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> District Attorney Ernie Lee said Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 12, Jason Lee Evans, 32, of Harrells, was fatally shot by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sheriff's Deputy</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Louis M. High Jr. following a robbery in Garland that extended into a high-speed car chase and subsequent shooting on N.C. 242 near Salemburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After reviewing the investigation with the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation, it is clear that Evans' </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> while tragic, was justified because Evans' actions caused </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Deputy</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> High to reasonably believe it necessary to use deadly force to protect the lives of (himself) and Sgt. Edward Vann,&quot; Lee said in a lengthy statement released Thursday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the release, the district attorney lays out the evidence in the case and the details of the investigation that occurred in the weeks that followed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The investigation revealed that prior to the shooting, Evans had committed a robbery of the Han-Dee Hugo's convenience store located at 19 N. Ingold Ave., Garland, was armed with an illegally sawed-off single barrel 410 Revelation shotgun, fired the shotgun at the Han-Dee Hugo's and engaged in a high-speed chase traveling in excess of 100 mph from Garland to near Roseboro.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After using stop sticks to cause Evans to stop his vehicle on N.C. 242 between Reeda Branch Road and Corinth Church Road, Evans exited his vehicle in the presence of two </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deputies,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> High and Vann, with his sawed-off shotgun. Vann warned Evans to drop his shotgun but Evans kept the shotgun in his right hand toward his own head and refused to follow the commands of law enforcement to put the shotgun down. High fired his law enforcement issued 9 mm handgun, hitting Evans four times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Although tragic that a life was lost, the shooting </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of Evans is found to be justified to protect the safety and lives of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Deputy</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> High and Sgt. Vann from potential harm as perceived by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Deputy</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> High,&quot; Lee stated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deputy</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was placed on paid administrative leave pending the investigation. The SBI dispatched agents to N.C. 242 to investigate the shooting. Lee kept in close contact with SBI Special Agent Bradley Williams, the lead investigator in the case, throughout the probe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On May 8, Lee said he viewed the video of the armed robbery at the Han-Dee Hugo's as well as the footage from a video camera mounted on Vann's vehicle that captured the high-speed chase and subsequent shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Video footage shows that at about 11:30 p.m., as Evans entered the convenience store he fired one shot from his shotgun into the ceiling and told the two clerks he wanted the registers emptied. Evans reloaded the shotgun while in the store and obtained money during the robbery. At 11:32 p.m., one of the clerks was able to activate the silent alarm, dispatching </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deputies</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to the store minutes later. The exterior video camera system at the convenience store shows Evans leaving the store in a white four-door Chevrolet Malibu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At approximately 11:41 p.m., Vann observed the Malibu on N.C. 411 and began his pursuit, reaching speeds in excess of 100 mph. Moments later, High placed stop sticks in the highway in an attempt to stop the Malibu. The vehicle struck the stop sticks and eventually one of his tires began to shred. High and Vann continued their pursuit of Evans, who was seen reaching into his backseat by Vann.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tire on Evans' vehicle continued to shred and he was eventually riding on the exposed rim, at which point he finally stopped between Reeda Branch Road and Corinth Church Road, approximately 20 miles from the convenience store in Garland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vann's in-car camera video shows Evans exiting his vehicle with his shotgun in his right hand. Vann repeatedly yelled at Evans to put the weapon down and he continued to move away from his car and in the direction of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deputies,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lee stated. He inched closer to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deputies</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with the shotgun to his head, never firing the weapon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement made to the SBI, High gave an account consistent with the video recording of the pursuit and the shooting, Lee noted. He said he felt threatened by Evans as the man moved from the Malibu and in a direction towards the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deputies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At approximately 11:49 p.m., Lee said, High fired his Sig Sauer P226 9mm service handgun at Evans, firing six rounds in total and striking Evans four times. Vann pulled his service handgun but did not fire his weapon. Evans was killed at the scene. The sawed-off shotgun was found next to Evans, loaded with one shotgun shell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Medical Examiner Dr. Carl Barr, who conducted an autopsy on Evans, confirmed four gunshot wounds, one grazing Evans' right forearm and another that went through his left arm, neither of which were life-threatening. The other two gunshot wounds were to Evans' neck and his head, which was lethal, Barr said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lee cited N.C. General Statute 15A-401, which states that when making an arrest a law enforcement officer is justified in using deadly physical force upon another person to defend himself or a third person from what he reasonably believes to be the use or imminent use of deadly physical force. Additionally, he said, general rules of self-defense and defense of others in North Carolina allow for the use of deadly force when the individual actually, or honestly, believed in the need to defend himself or others from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or great bodily injury, the District attorney said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Clearly, from the facts and circumstances of this case, the officer was justified in using deadly force to defend himself and others from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or great bodily injury,&quot; Lee remarked. &quot;Law enforcement officers are required to instantaneously evaluate and employ force against possible criminal suspects to thwart apparent dangers to citizens and themselves. Officers must perceive, evaluate, decide and then act often in a matter of seconds. The perceived danger to the officer must be only apparent, not actual, in order to justify use of deadly force.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although there is evidence of actual danger to High, under the law there was also apparent danger as perceived by him, Lee stated. From the evidence, he noted, it &quot;reasonably appeared&quot; to High there was sufficient basis for self-defense and defense of third persons, his fellow </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deputy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Based upon my review of the facts of this case, I have determined that the shooting of Jason Lee Evans on April 12, 2015 was justified to protect the safety and lives of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Deputy</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> High and Sgt. Vann as the threat appeared to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Deputy</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> High,&quot; Lee said. &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Deputy</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> High perceived an apparent threat, evaluated the situation in split seconds, made a decision and acted. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Deputy</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> High's actions appear reasonable under all the circumstances of this case.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From all the evidence, High initially exercised restraint in the face of imminent danger as Evans exited his vehicle with a loaded weapon in a manner that could reasonably be deemed as threatening, the district attorney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As tragic as this incident is with the loss of life, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Deputy</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> High nonetheless was justified in defending himself from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or great bodily injury and in defending the life of fellow officer, Sgt. Vann,&quot; Lee concluded. &quot;There is insufficient evidence beyond a reasonable doubt to show that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Deputy</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> High acted in a manner that was not consistent with his perception of an apparent threat.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7"> BODY:<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new report shows that US </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have shot and killed 385 people during the first five months of 2015, an average of more than two </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">fatal</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shootings a day.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rate is over twice the account tallied by the federal government during the past 10 years, which officials admit is incomplete, according to a Washington Post analysis published on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These shootings are grossly under&shy;reported,&quot; said Jim Bueermann, a former </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> chief and president of the Washington-based </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Foundation, a nonprofit organization which works to improve law enforcement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are never going to reduce the number of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shootings if we don't begin to accurately track this information,&quot; Bueermann was quoted by The Post as saying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The analysis is the result of information The Post is compiling on every </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">fatal</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shooting by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in 2015 in addition to data of every </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> killed by gunfire in the line of duty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The data is related to shootings and does not include killings by other means, such as stun guns and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deaths</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> custody.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The study shows that almost half the victims were minority. However, the demographics shifted markedly among the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unarmed</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">victims,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with two-thirds being African American or Hispanic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the whole, US </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> killed blacks at three times the rate of whites or other minorities when adjusting by the population of the census tracts, where the shootings took place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Los Angeles </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Department engages in an altercation that ended in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of a homeless man on March 1, 2015.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A large proportion of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">victims,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> over 80 percent, were </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with objects, including guns, knives, machetes, revving vehicles and, in one case, a nail gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">49 people were not armed with any weapons, while the guns used by 13 others were not real. Overall, 16 percent were either carrying a toy or were unarmed, according to The Post.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several current and former </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> chiefs and other criminal justice officials said it was time </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> accepted responsibility for the bloodshed. They argued that a vast majority of the killings, examined by The Post, resulted from poor policing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have to get beyond what is legal and start focusing on what is preventable. Most are preventable,&quot; said Ronald L. Davis, a former </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> chief, who heads the Justice Department's Office of Community Oriented Policing Services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;need to stop chasing down suspects, hopping fences and landing on top of someone with a gun,&quot; Davis said. &quot;When they do that, they have no choice but to shoot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report came as many US cities have been the scene of protests over the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deaths</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of several unarmed African Americans by white </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and decisions by grand juries not to indict the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another analysis by The Post and researchers at Bowling Green State University, released last week, showed that only 54 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have been charged for thousands of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">fatal</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shootings at the hands of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> across the United States over the past decade.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only three months apart in 2013, Brent Brozek, 43, and Charles Carll, 59, both white, were killed by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Brozek had mental health problems and had come at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with a sword outside his condo, and Carll had advanced on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with a knife in his backyard, according to investigators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul Heenan, 30, was killed on Nov. 9, 2012, in the front yard of an East Side home after being reported as a possible burglary </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">suspect</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Heenan, who was white, was </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unarmed</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> but intoxicated and allegedly reached for the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> gun during a struggle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In what I've always thought was the least justified killing of the six, a 26-year-old white woman, Ashley DiPiazza, was shot and killed by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a year ago Monday after she refused orders to drop a gun ? which she was pointing at her own head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one else was in the apartment where the DiPiazza shooting occurred, and nearby apartments were evacuated ? so it's unlikely DiPiazza would have been able to put anyone else in danger. Instead of setting up a perimeter outside the building, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> entered the apartment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When about 30 minutes' worth of trying to talk her down failed, she walked out of a bedroom toward the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who shot her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ruben Anthony, president and CEO of the Urban League, said the Robinson killing and the other killings are &quot;not comparable situations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In all but the Heenan situation, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">suspect</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; he said. &quot;According to the DA's findings (on Tuesday), the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was informed Tony was unarmed.&quot; That is an important detail, but then so are lots of details.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heenan, the unarmed white man, for example, wasn't reported to be &quot;acting insane&quot; and on hallucinogenic mushrooms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He wasn't a suspect in three assaults and possibly engaged in a fourth when </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> arrived. He didn't ambush and strike an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the head from the top of a 4-foot-wide stairway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those are all things Robinson did or was suspected of doing in the minutes before he was killed, according to the state's investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Study after study after study has shown that African- Americans face more severe outcomes when they come into contact with law enforcement,&quot; Anthony noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's true, and if all that were needed to determine a specific </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> culpability in a specific </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shooting were studies, there would be no need for investigations of the details of a specific </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> culpability in a specific </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, we all pay attention to different details, sometimes because those are the most important details to pay attention to and sometimes because those are the details we prefer or need ? for a variety of reasons ? to pay attention to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the possible exception of Johnson, none of the six people Madison </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have shot and killed since November 2012 did anything in the moments before they died that was deserving of their fate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But they all had life circumstances and made decisions that made it more likely for them to be involved in the kinds of violent encounters with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that can end in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neither are any of their stories any more tragic than any of the others ? or any less of a reason for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the public to constantly be reviewing and improving </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> procedures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That Robinson's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> can look like another suspicious killing of an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unarmed</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> black </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">suspect</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> doesn't mean that it is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nor does it make Madison </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the same as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Ferguson, Missouri, or New York City or Baltimore.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7"> BODY:<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Brelo, a white Cleveland </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> indicted for jumping on a car hood to fire a deadly volley of gunfire at two unarmed motorists in 2012, has been found not guilty by a county judge in Ohio, reiterating the complex dynamics that make it hard to find </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> guilty of crimes committed as they carry out their duty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deaths</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of Timothy Russell and Malissa Williams, both black, were included as a point of criticism in a 2014 US Department of Justice report that called for a federal monitor to oversee the Cleveland </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Department. The not guilty verdict &nbsp;on Saturday&nbsp;comes amid heightened scrutiny and protest around </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shooting </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deaths,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> including the looming outcome of an investigation into the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of 12-year-old Tamir Rice by two Cleveland </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in November.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verdict also came on a day that saw more protests in Olympia, Wash., where a white </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;on Thursday&nbsp;shot two black skateboarders after they allegedly shoplifted beer. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> say the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was attacked by the two young men before he fired. Both men are expected to survive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the dynamics of the 2012 shooting, the verdict reflects in part the difficulty of prosecuting </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for heat of the moment decisions. Last year, two grand juries - one in Ferguson, Mo., the other in Staten Island - declined to return criminal charges against </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> involved in the killing of unarmed black men. Protests and riots have followed such acquittals.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week, a Baltimore grand jury indicted six </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for their alleged roles in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of a black man named Freddie Gray. Mr. Gray's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> caused two separate spasms of localized riots in Baltimore before the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Brelo, the Cleveland </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was indicted for voluntary manslaughter for jumping on the hood of a car that had been under </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> fire and shooting repeatedly down into the windshield. Whether any of Brelo's 15 fired bullets were the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">fatal</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> blows was a key question in the trial, given that each victim received over 20 bullet wounds a piece.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cuyahoga County Judge John P. O'Donnell also determined that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Brelo was not guilty of two lesser-included counts of felonious assault.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a nod to wide legal latitude given to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in dangerous situations, Judge O'Donnell found that Brelo, in the heat of the moment, reasonably perceived a threat from the two motorists. He, however, &quot;ran afoul of the Constitution&quot; when he got on top of the car, since that's a tactic that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are not trained to do, Mr. O'Donnell noted. Brelo could still face other charges for his actions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">O'Donnell also said that while forensics showed that Ms. Williams received at least one </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">fatal</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shot from Brelo's gun, he couldn't determine whether the other </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">fatal</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shots also came from Brelo. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> fired a total of 137 shots at the motorists after Russell's 1979 Chevy Malibu backfired in front of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> headquarters, sparking a dramatic chase. Brelo's actions came after the Malibu had come to a stop. Neither of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">victims was armed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department report, which was in part sparked by the Brelo case, determined late last year that Cleveland </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had for years been engaged in a pattern of using excessive force against citizens and violating people's civil rights in other ways.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not clear how people will react to the verdict. Protests against </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> brutality have roiled the US since the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., last year. The Monitor reported on Saturday that the &quot;hands up, don't shoot&quot; movement has been used by protesters as far away as Jordan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge O'Donnell decided to read the verdict&nbsp;on Saturday&nbsp;to reduce the risk of protests. The judge said he was well aware of the tensions around allegations of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> brutality and a sense among many Americans that there's not enough justice for unarmed people killed by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. O'Donnell specifically cited the Tamir Rice case as he read his verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every week, I pass a mountain of stuffed animals left in memory of a 12-year-old that many people believe was murdered by the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Montgomery County </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sheriff</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ladson O'Connor was killed early Tuesday when he crashed while pursuing an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed suspect</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The suspect later surrendered after exchanging gunfire with authorities.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GBI spokeswoman Sherry Lang said the incident began around midnight in Toombs County, a rural community about three hours southeast of Atlanta. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Deputies</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> there were assisting a motorist when the driver of another vehicle --- believed to be 35-year-old Jim Edward Lowery --- &quot;attempted to leave the area&quot; after spotting them, Lang said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That piqued the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deputies'</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> interest and they attempted to initiate a traffic stop. Lowery fled, authorities said, and O'Connor joined in the chase when it continued on Ga. 56 into nearby Montgomery County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During the pursuit, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sheriff</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> O'Connor lost control of his vehicle, wrecked and was dead on the scene,&quot; Lang said. Montgomery County is about two hours southeast of Atlanta in southeast Georgia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What may have led O'Connor to lose control was unclear, though Lang said either Lowery or 36-year-old passenger Nicole Dixie Best fired shots at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> during the chase. An autopsy was being performed at the GBI's crime lab in Savannah, Lang said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chase ended near the town of Uvalda, where state troopers had placed &quot;stop sticks&quot; on the road, Lang said. Lowery crashed his vehicle and managed to escape --- for a few hours, at least.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At about 9:30 a.m. Tuesday, Georgia State Patrol SWAT team members located Lowery in McNatt Falls, a town in Montgomery County. Lowery surrendered after an exchange of gunfire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Lowery had sustained an injury to his leg but it is unknown at this time if the injury is a result of the shooting or if it occurred while he was on the run from law enforcement,&quot; Lang said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lowery was arrested and charged with three counts of aggravated assault on a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and one count of fleeing and attempting to elude a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Best, the passenger in his vehicle, was also detained and &quot;is being held in the Montgomery County jail while warrants are being obtained for her arrest,&quot; Lang said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was unclear what charges Best will face.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GBI is investigating both the chase and the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-involved shooting that occurred during Lowery's apprehension, Lang said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">O'Connor, 42, had served as the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">sheriff</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of Montgomery County since January 2013. He leaves behind a wife and four children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Messages left with the Montgomery County </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sheriff's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Office on Tuesday were not immediately returned. Several metro Atlanta agencies took to social media Tuesday to express their condolences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our thoughts and prayers are with the family of Montgomery County </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sheriff</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ladson O'Connor and with the Montgomery County </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sheriff's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Office,&quot; the Gwinnett County </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sheriff's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Office wrote on Facebook.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Montgomery County </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sheriff</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ladson O'Connor was killed early Tuesday when he crashed while pursuing an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed suspect</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The suspect later surrendered after exchanging gunfire with authorities.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GBI spokeswoman Sherry Lang said the incident began around midnight in Toombs County, a rural community about three hours southeast of Atlanta. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Deputies</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> there were assisting a motorist when the driver of another vehicle --- believed to be 35-year-old Jim Edward Lowery --- &quot;attempted to leave the area&quot; after spotting them, Lang said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That piqued the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deputies'</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> interest and they attempted to initiate a traffic stop. Lowery fled, authorities said, and O'Connor joined in the chase when it continued on Ga. 56 into nearby Montgomery County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During the pursuit, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sheriff</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> O'Connor lost control of his vehicle, wrecked and was dead on the scene,&quot; Lang said. Montgomery County is about two hours southeast of Atlanta in southeast Georgia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What may have led O'Connor to lose control was unclear, though Lang said either Lowery or 36-year-old passenger Nicole Dixie Best fired shots at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> during the chase. An autopsy was being performed at the GBI's crime lab in Savannah, Lang said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chase ended near the town of Uvalda, where state troopers had placed &quot;stop sticks&quot; on the road, Lang said. Lowery crashed his vehicle and managed to escape --- for a few hours, at least.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At about 9:30 a.m. Tuesday, Georgia State Patrol SWAT team members located Lowery in McNatt Falls, a town in Montgomery County. Lowery surrendered after an exchange of gunfire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Lowery had sustained an injury to his leg but it is unknown at this time if the injury is a result of the shooting or if it occurred while he was on the run from law enforcement,&quot; Lang said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lowery was arrested and charged with three counts of aggravated assault on a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and one count of fleeing and attempting to elude a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Best, the passenger in his vehicle, was also detained and &quot;is being held in the Montgomery County jail while warrants are being obtained for her arrest,&quot; Lang said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was unclear what charges Best will face.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GBI is investigating both the chase and the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-involved shooting that occurred during Lowery's apprehension, Lang said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">O'Connor, 42, had served as the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">sheriff</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of Montgomery County since January 2013. He leaves behind a wife and four children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Messages left with the Montgomery County </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sheriff's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Office on Tuesday were not immediately returned. Several metro Atlanta agencies took to social media Tuesday to express their condolences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our thoughts and prayers are with the family of Montgomery County </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sheriff</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ladson O'Connor and with the Montgomery County </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sheriff's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Office,&quot; the Gwinnett County </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sheriff's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Office wrote on Facebook.</SPAN></P>

In addition to collecting the suspected stolen jewelry, Det. Petillo interviewed the jeweler who recalled an unknown male who remained outside. Petillo responded to another pawn shop which revealed video of an attempt to sell items by the suspects. No sale was made, but video evidence was gathered. Neptune City </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> located one of the suspects and detained him. An interview was conducted which implicated others.

Both suspects had outstanding warrants and were certain persons not to possess weapons. The recovery methods used by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chunn in recovering the weapon will assist with future prosecution against the accused in this ongoing investigation.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Nov. 12, 2014, Detective Chapman was driving to work on Route 33 in Freehold Township when he observed a male in his 50s clinging to the outer rail of a four story overpass. It appeared that the male was preparing to jump to his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Detective Chapman immediately turned around, parked his vehicle and approached the male on foot. As he approached the male, the man told Detective Chapman that he had nothing to live for and he was going to kill himself. Due to Detective Chapman's narcotic training and experience, he immediately associated the male's violent trembling and shaking to be related to narcotics and/or alcohol withdrawal. Detective Chapman calmly engaged the male in conversation and convinced him that his life was worth living and not to jump. Detective Chapman called the Freehold Township </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Department while he continued to talk and comfort the male. Subsequently, the male allowed Detective Chapman to physically pull him to safety. For his effort Detective Chapman receives a merit award.

Their efforts resulted in the return of approximately $25,000 worth of property to its rightful owners. These efforts also solidified the case against the suspects by providing definite proof of the fact they were pawning stolen goods in multiple locations. It should be noted the suspects were still actively involved in committing burglaries at the time of their arrests.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Nov. 14, 2014 members of the Middletown Township Fire Department were dispatched to Ocean Boulevard in the Leonardo section of Middletown on a reported structure fire with a possible entrapment. Upon arrival heavy fire was visible coming from a two-story wood frame structure involving both the first and second floors, totally blocking the front entrance door. Firefighters Jack Hueston, while conducting a 360 assessment of the scene, was advised that there was someone trapped inside the burning structure and was yelling for help. At this time Firefighters Hueston, Christian Burbank and John Waltz began to conduct a Vent-Enter-Search (VES) operation of two windows on the first floor. This was the area that had been pointed out earlier, as the last place that calls for help were coming from. After venting and clearing the two windows heavy black turbulent smoke vented from each window filling the both openings completely. Firefighters Burbank and Waltz searched the interior below each window sill from the exterior with negative results. Several seconds later the smoke condition raised slightly allowing firefighters Hueston, Burbank and Waltz to enter to conduct a search. The unconscious victim was located lying on the floor approximately 10 to 12 feet from the entry window. Firefighters Michael Chenoweth, Matthew Deickmann and James Phillips partially entered the burning structure from the window, and after several failed attempts to lift the victim out, a rescue strap was placed around the victims upper torso to provide added leverage to get the victim up and out to a safe location. After removal of the victim by rescuers, they began to administer basic life support techniques.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mortally wounded Louis Anthony  Louie  Pompei led </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deputies</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to his assailants, 20 years ago tonight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That deadly night, June 9, 1995, Pompei fired his gun and hit his attackers enough times that they needed emergency assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those bullets and eyewitnesses  description of the fleeing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed suspects</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  vehicle led to the teenage killers  quick apprehension at Queen of the Valley Hospital in West Covina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Law-enforcement agents from several jurisdictions, according to Glendora </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chief Tim Staab, went into instant action after the wounded Pompei dialed 9-1-1 from a pay phone outside of Vons Market before collapsing.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pompei, 30, and a 7-year veteran of the Glendora </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Department, had just gotten off duty with L.A. Impact   a regional anti-drug trafficking task force comprised of Los Angeles County </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">sheriff</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> s </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deputies</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and municipal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. He went to Vons Market near his San Dimas home to cash his paycheck. He was in the checkout line when two young men, later identified as Larry Hernandez, 16, and Robert Ramirez, 17, entered the store, announced a holdup and began pistol-whipping a box boy, according to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Louie did what he was trained to do as a policeman,  Staab said.  Whether he is on- or off-duty, he was sworn to protect, serve and defend. He drew his gun and identified himself as a policeman to stop the attack on the special-needs employee. Gun fire ensued, but Louie drew fire away from customers and employees in the store and toward himself. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a Glendora </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> memo, Pompei was hit five times, once in the upper right chest, three in the abdomen and one in the thigh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although the bullet that hit him in the chest was a through-and-through, it took out a ventricle to Louie s heart,  lamented the still-grieving Staab.  That just killed him. He died during surgery at San Dimas Community Hospital. Louie remains the only Glendora </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> killed in the line of duty since the department was founded in 1926.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He remained loyal to the Law Enforcement Code of Ethics which notes, in part, that an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> s  fundamental duty is to serve mankind, safeguard lives and property and protect the innocent against deception, the weak against oppression or intimidation and the peaceful against violence or disorder.  Louie upheld that code to the end,  Staab said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pompei wounded the two assailants in the store before they escaped to a waiting silver Toyota Tercel. Witnesses provided a description of the car for a crime broadcast and a Pasadena </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Department helicopter used in an earlier L.A. Impact aerial surveillance went airborne again, joining county and municipal law-enforcement agents on the ground searching for the suspects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two Los Angeles County </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sheriff</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> s Department Special Enforcement Bureau </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deputies</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had just dropped two prisoners at the Industry </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sheriff</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> s Station. Knowing the area and following instinct, they went to Queen of the Valley Hospital in West Covina to check for the suspects and vehicle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They found Hernandez and Ramirez in the emergency room claiming they d been wounded in a drive-by shooting in San Dimas and had been driven to the hospital by Larry Hernandez s brother, Daniel, 19.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deputies</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> saw Daniel Hernandez outside the hospital, questioned him and impounded the vehicle. A search warrant netted blood stains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Deputy</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> District Attorney Mark Arnold of the Crimes Against Peace </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unit tried the two juveniles as adults. It took a jury of seven women and five men three hours to convict Ramirez and Larry Hernandez, the shooters inside the market, of first-degree murder of a policeman, a special circumstance that eliminates the opportunity for parole on their life sentences. The two were also convicted of assaulting a Vons employee during the robbery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Daniel Hernandez confessed to planning the robbery and driving the getaway car. He testified against his brother and Ramirez to avoid the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> penalty, allowable under the law when convicted by a jury. Daniel Hernandez was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to 26 years to life in prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the arrest of the three, Staab said, investigating </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> learned they were suspected in series of San Gabriel Valley supermarket robberies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Their violence was steadily increasing. They had pistol-whipped a shopper at an earlier market robbery, so their violence was escalating even before the firefight with Louie,  Staab said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pompei, 30, and a 7-year veteran of the Glendora </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Department, had just gotten off duty with L.A. Impact   a regional anti-drug trafficking task force comprised of Los Angeles County </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">sheriff</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> s </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deputies</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and municipal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. He went to Vons Market near his San Dimas home to cash his paycheck. He was in the checkout line when two young men, later identified as Larry Hernandez, 16, and Robert Ramirez, 17, entered the store, announced a holdup and began pistol-whipping a box boy, according to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Louie did what he was trained to do as a policeman,  Staab said.  Whether he is on- or off-duty, he was sworn to protect, serve and defend. He drew his gun and identified himself as a policeman to stop the attack on the special-needs employee. Gun fire ensued, but Louie drew fire away from customers and employees in the store and toward himself. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a Glendora </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> memo, Pompei was hit five times, once in the upper right chest, three in the abdomen and one in the thigh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although the bullet that hit him in the chest was a through-and-through, it took out a ventricle to Louie s heart,  lamented the still-grieving Staab.  That just killed him. He died during surgery at San Dimas Community Hospital. Louie remains the only Glendora </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> killed in the line of duty since the department was founded in 1926.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He remained loyal to the Law Enforcement Code of Ethics which notes, in part, that an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> s  fundamental duty is to serve mankind, safeguard lives and property and protect the innocent against deception, the weak against oppression or intimidation and the peaceful against violence or disorder.  Louie upheld that code to the end,  Staab said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pompei wounded the two assailants in the store before they escaped to a waiting silver Toyota Tercel. Witnesses provided a description of the car for a crime broadcast and a Pasadena </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Department helicopter used in an earlier L.A. Impact aerial surveillance went airborne again, joining county and municipal law-enforcement agents on the ground searching for the suspects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two Los Angeles County </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sheriff</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> s Department Special Enforcement Bureau </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deputies</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had just dropped two prisoners at the Industry </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sheriff</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> s Station. Knowing the area and following instinct, they went to Queen of the Valley Hospital in West Covina to check for the suspects and vehicle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They found Hernandez and Ramirez in the emergency room claiming they d been wounded in a drive-by shooting in San Dimas and had been driven to the hospital by Larry Hernandez s brother, Daniel, 19.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deputies</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> saw Daniel Hernandez outside the hospital, questioned him and impounded the vehicle. A search warrant netted blood stains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Deputy</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> District Attorney Mark Arnold of the Crimes Against Peace </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unit tried the two juveniles as adults. It took a jury of seven women and five men three hours to convict Ramirez and Larry Hernandez, the shooters inside the market, of first-degree murder of a policeman, a special circumstance that eliminates the opportunity for parole on their life sentences. The two were also convicted of assaulting a Vons employee during the robbery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Daniel Hernandez confessed to planning the robbery and driving the getaway car. He testified against his brother and Ramirez to avoid the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> penalty, allowable under the law when convicted by a jury. Daniel Hernandez was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to 26 years to life in prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the arrest of the three, Staab said, investigating </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> learned they were suspected in series of San Gabriel Valley supermarket robberies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Their violence was steadily increasing. They had pistol-whipped a shopper at an earlier market robbery, so their violence was escalating even before the firefight with Louie,  Staab said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although the bullet that hit him in the chest was a through-and-through, it took out a ventricle to Louie s heart,  lamented the still-grieving Staab.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That deadly night, June 9, 1995, Pompei fired his gun and hit his attackers enough times that they needed emergency assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those bullets and eyewitnesses  description of the fleeing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed suspects</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  vehicle led to the teenage killers  quick apprehension at Queen of the Valley Hospital in West Covina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Law-enforcement agents from several jurisdictions, according to Glendora </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chief Tim Staab, went into instant action after the wounded Pompei dialed 9-1-1 from a pay phone outside of Vons Market before collapsing.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pompei, 30, and a 7-year veteran of the Glendora </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Department, had just gotten off duty with L.A.

He went to Vons Market near his San Dimas home to cash his paycheck. He was in the checkout line when two young men, later identified as Larry Hernandez, 16, and Robert Ramirez, 17, entered the store, announced a holdup and began pistol-whipping a box boy, according to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Louie did what he was trained to do as a policeman,  Staab said.  Whether he is on- or off-duty, he was sworn to protect, serve and defend. He drew his gun and identified himself as a policeman to stop the attack on the special-needs employee. Gun fire ensued, but Louie drew fire away from customers and employees in the store and toward himself. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a Glendora </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> memo, Pompei was hit five times, once in the upper right chest, three in the abdomen and one in the thigh.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7"> BODY:<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eric Garner in New York's Staten Island, Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., Walter Scott in Summerville, S.C. And now Freddie Gray, right here in our beloved Charm City, becomes the latest citizen to join a macabre roster: the growing list of unarmed black men killed by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police, their deaths</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> thrust into the national spotlight, generating scrutiny and outrage. The seeming explosion of such cases around the country prompted me to engage my social research methods students at University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) in a project: examining trends in deadly-force incidents that have occurred here in the Baltimore/D.C. area over the last 25 years (1990 to 2015) by searching The Baltimore Sun and The Washington Post news archives for all cases in which a citizen was killed by an on-duty </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We assumed that any such case that resulted in a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would generate at least a brief news story, and so we set about carefully collecting and coding key pieces of information from these articles, including details such as the work shift during which the interaction happened, whether the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">suspect</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or noted to be mentally ill, and the experience level of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who did the shooting. Students wondered if there really are more cases now than in the past due, perhaps, to more militarized styles of policing, or if the seeming increase in cases is simply a figment of the media attention. What can we learn about the patterns and themes that characterize these cases?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No official data</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You might be surprised, as were my students, to learn that we currently have no way of really knowing how common </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> use of lethal force against citizens actually is, as no systematic data is collected to track such incidents, despite pleas for accountability from public intellectuals right here in Baltimore like David Simon, creator of HBO's &quot;The Wire.&quot; Unlike as with most other crime data, there is no mandatory reporting of these incidents to the FBI's Uniform Crime database. Considering how much data is compiled on each of us every day by government entities and corporations alike, it seems odd that no data at all is assembled to document these cases. Without data, it is far too easy to dismiss the magnitude or pattern of a behavior. By contrast, extensive data is collected and indexed by the FBI for each case in which a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is killed or assaulted in the line of duty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which record and classify the manner of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for all Americans, keep the only systematic national documentation of any kind that reports upon citizens killed by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These are categorized as &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deaths</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by legal intervention,&quot; and the name itself says much about how we regard such cases. Blacks (mostly males) made up 29 percent of the 159 incidents recorded in 2008 (the last year for which a report compiling this data was published), but they make up just over 13 percent of the overall American population. In 2013, a total of 27 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were feloniously killed while on duty. Given that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deaths</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by legal intervention are four times more common than are cases of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> killed in the line of duty, shouldn't we also be collecting and tracking data for these incidents?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When my students and I examined cases of citizens being killed by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> here in the Baltimore/DC area over the last 25 years, several interesting observations emerge:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Killings peaked in 1993</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(1) It is a misnomer that there are more cases of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> use of deadly force now than at any point in the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In our data, the year with the most </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deaths</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (27) was 1993. There were 21 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deaths</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in 1994, but then rates declined for several years until a spike of cases occurred 2002, when there were 20 incidents. The average number of cases per year was 10.7. It seems worth noting that community policing became very popular across this country in the mid 1990s but was then eclipsed by a more militaristic approach after 9/11.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(2) The vast majority of cases in which </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> kill a citizen do impact black men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the 262 cases we identified in which the victim's sex was reported, only 6 percent (16 cases) were women. Curiously, the race of the victim was much less frequently reported in news articles, but in the 50 cases for which the victim's race was reported, 76 percent of the dead citizens were black; 16 percent were Latino or Hispanic; 4 percent were white; and 4 percent were Asian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1990, according to U.S. Census data, 39.1 percent of residents in the city of Baltimore were white. By 2000, that number had dropped to 31.6 percent -- where it remains as of 2013. In the District of Columbia, 29.6 percent of residents were white in 1990. That figure had climbed to 43.4 percent in 2013.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So black men really are dying at a higher rate than they are represented in the broader population, very likely due to the war on drugs, which generated more scrutiny and aggressive policing of black neighborhoods. Our public policies directed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to work in this way; we must now challenge and support them to take a different approach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(3) Contrary to popular opinion, most victims of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shootings are not very young men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It turns out that the average age of victims was 31.7 years, which was pretty close to the median age of 29.5. Victims in our study ranged from 2 to 78 years of age, but a relative few (6.4 percent) were under 18, and many were in their 30s and 40s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Victims</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are usually </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(4) In the great number of cases, the citizen was noted as having been armed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In nearly half (48.5 percent) of the cases we examined, a gun was allegedly found on the victim. In 17.5 percent of cases, there was a knife reportedly found, and in about a quarter of cases (23.2 percent), no weapon was reported. In a small number of cases (9.3 percent), the weapon was otherwise classified (dogs, cars, umbrellas, etc.), or there were multiple weapons present (1.5 percent of cases). In 64.9 percent of cases, the citizen was noted as having been brandishing a weapon, but that leaves at least one-third of cases in which no weapon was displayed to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And after the Walter Scott video, we have to assume that some of the weapons that were allegedly present/being brandished could have been planted or posed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(5) The vast majority of these incidents occurred early in an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> career, during their second and fifth years of service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was one of the most interesting things we found. Of the 116 cases in which the tenure of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was known, the average number of years in service of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who killed the citizen was 8.4 years, but the median was just six years and the mode (most common year of service noted) was just two years (15 of the 116 cases, or 12.9 percent). A full 52.6 percent of these cases occur within the first six years of an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> service. Crossing the tenure of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> service against whether a weapon was brandished indicates negative relationship between years of service and the use of deadly force -- meaning that older </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were more likely to reserve force for cases in which the citizen/suspect pulled a weapon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is also quite possible that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the earlier years of service are more likely to be out patrolling streets and encountering incidents that escalate to the use of force. Perhaps </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could be better trained early on to respond in different ways -- or to engage principles of community policing so as to reduce the general level of potential violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Dysfuntional pattern'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The civil unrest generated by public reaction to the national spotlight being shown upon this issue should make us all wonder whether we, as a society, are capable of interracial policing. In the end, of course, we must be able to do this work in an open, just and civil manner. To reach that goal, however, we must honestly and candidly examine how we have been policing by using the sometimes-harsh mirror that objective social data provides. Most </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> interactions are respectful and professional, but a significant dysfunctional pattern exists in how white </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> interact with black suspects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have seen the worst of this behavior displayed so candidly in the Walter Scott video: an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> appearing to shoot a suspect in cold blood and then plant a weapon on the victim. These are things that black men have long told us happen more often than we want to believe. And while the video highlights a specific incident, it finally prompted an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to be charged with murder in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of a citizen. In Baltimore on Friday, six city </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were charged criminally in Freddie Gray's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Though the charges each received varied, all were charged with some form of assault and misconduct in office; one was charged with second-degree, depraved heart murder -- the most serious of the charges brought -- and others were charged with involuntary manslaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Too often, without a video, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are exonerated via internal investigations based on rules that prioritize </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers'</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> accounts. Let's start collecting the data we need to track and systematically examine such incidents and use it to challenge and improve upon our policing until it fully reflects the integrity of our American ideal of equality under the law.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They will gather to remember Brandon Duncan at a downtown agency that serves local homeless and marginalized residents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, local political activists are planning to protest the use of lethal weapons by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> following the shooting </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of Duncan.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ed Pickersgill coordinates 40 Baker Street, which houses several programs and organizations that serve &quot;the unemployed, needy and dispossessed out of poverty,&quot; according to its website. Duncan was a long-time client of Fresh Start Housing Centre, which is located at 40 Baker. Fresh Start helps the homeless find shelter and sustainable housing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Duncan, 36, was killed in the emergency department at around 1:30 p.m. on May 20, during an interaction with two Guelph </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police officers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He was shot multiple times. The Special Investigations Unit has 12 investigators probing the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The investigation is ongoing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Duncan suffered from mental illness, addiction, and Crohn's disease, according to friends and associates in the community. He accessed services for the homeless over at least a 15 year period, and had several lengthy stays in hospital related to Crohn's. Pickersgill is dedicating the Monday pizza dinner at 40 Baker Street to Duncan. It runs from 4:15 p.m. to 5:15 p.m. People will be invited to share their thoughts and reactions on a large sheet of paper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the Facebook event page for the memorial, Pickersgill states Duncan was in &quot;a serious personal crisis resulting from homelessness, Crohn's, addiction, loneliness and fear,&quot; at the time of his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We at 40 Baker Street would like to share our pizza day supper on Monday 1st of June in memory of Brandon Duncan so that (1) his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> not go unmarked in his community; and (2) pizza and juice and music on that day be an occasion for those who knew him personally and for those who have shared in similar circumstances to have a chance to give a nod of understanding that his life did matter and that he simply should not have died the way he did.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Area funeral homes have been contacted and none are as yet managing memorial/burial arrangements for Duncan. The SIU would not comment this week on whether Duncan's body has been released for burial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's unclear where Duncan's next of kin reside. The SIU said a family member consented to release his name to the public. That person's identity has not been made public. Associates of Duncan in Guelph have asserted that they have no knowledge of him having relatives in the city. They believe he was raised in Fergus by his grandparents, who are deceased.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monday's event at 40 Baker Street may also involve planning for a protest at an upcoming Guelph </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Services Board meeting, said Sakura Saunders.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said discussions are underway to organize a Guelph protest or advocacy event against the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> use of lethal force.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People are definitely disturbed about it,&quot; Saunders said, speaking of the Duncan shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have seen a number of cases (elsewhere)of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shooting people who were attempting self-harm or having mental health issues - coming in and shooting first and asking questions later,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7"> BODY:<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON --  During a training course on defending against knife attacks, a young Salt Lake City </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> asked a question: ''How close can somebody get to me before I'm justified in using deadly force?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dennis Tueller, the instructor in that class more than three decades ago, decided to find out. In the fall of 1982, he performed a rudimentary series of tests and concluded that an armed attacker who bolted toward an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could clear 21 feet in the time it took most </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to draw, aim and fire their weapon. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The next spring, Mr. Tueller published his findings in SWAT magazine and transformed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> training in the United States. The ''21-foot rule'' became dogma. It has been taught in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> academies around the country, accepted by courts and cited by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to justify countless shootings, including recent episodes involving a homeless woodcarver in Seattle and a schizophrenic woman in San Francisco.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Now, amid the largest national debate over policing since the 1991 beating of Rodney King in Los Angeles, a small but vocal set of law enforcement officials are calling for a rethinking of the 21-foot rule and other axioms that have emphasized how to use force, not how to avoid it. Several big-city </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> departments are already re-examining when </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> should chase people or draw their guns and when they should back away, wait or try to defuse the situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''In a democratic society, people have a say in how they are policed, and people are saying that they are not satisfied with how things are going,'' said Sean Whent, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> chief in Oakland, Calif. The city has a troubled history of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> abuse and misconduct, but some policy changes and a new approach to training have led to sharp declines in the use of force, Chief Whent added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Like the 21-foot rule, many current </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> practices were adopted when </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> faced violent street gangs. Crime rates soared, as did the number of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> killed. Today, crime is at historic lows and most cities are safer than they have been in generations, for residents and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> alike. This should be a moment of high confidence in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said Chuck Wexler, executive director of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Executive Research Forum, a law enforcement policy group. Instead, he said, policing is in crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''People aren't buying our brand. If it was a product, we'd take it out of the marketplace and re-engineer it,'' Mr. Wexler said. ''We've lost the confidence of the American people.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Wexler's group will meet with hundreds of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> leaders in Washington this week to call for a new era of training, one that replaces truisms such as the 21-foot rule with lessons on defusing tense situations and avoiding violent confrontations. While the Justice Department and chiefs of some major </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> departments are supportive, the effort has not been widely embraced, at least so far. Some </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> unions and others have expressed skepticism, saying </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are being unfairly criticized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''All this chatter just increases the idea that these encounters are avoidable and law enforcement is at fault,'' said Jeff Roorda of the St. Louis </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police Officers'</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Association, who said </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> already thought about ways to avoid confrontations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The typical </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cadet receives about 58 hours of training on how to use a gun and 49 hours on defensive tactics, according to a recent survey by Mr. Wexler's group. By comparison, cadets spend just eight hours learning to calm situations before force is needed, a technique called de-escalation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Everything now is: You get there, you see a guy with a knife, you resolve it,'' said Mr. Wexler, a former senior Boston </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> official. In many situations, he said, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who find themselves 21 feet from a suspect can simply take a step backward to buy themselves time and safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Tueller's article never proposed a bright line between a shooting that was justified and one that was not. In a telephone interview, Mr. Tueller, 63, said he had simply wanted to warn </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that they might be in danger far sooner than they realized. Twenty-one feet as a justification for shooting, he said, just became a ''sticky idea'' in policing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Dallas </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> chief, David O. Brown, said at a policing conference in February: ''Sometimes it seems like our young </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> want to get into an athletic event with people they want to arrest. They have a 'don't retreat' mentality. They feel like they're warriors and they can't back down when someone is running from them, no matter how minor the underlying crime is.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Those remarks came just weeks before a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in North Charleston, S.C., was charged with murder for shooting an unarmed man in the back. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had stopped the man, Walter L. Scott, because of a broken brake light. When Mr. Scott ran, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> gave chase, even though he had Mr. Scott's driver's license.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''In most cases, time is on our side,'' Chief Whent, of Oakland, said in an interview. ''We're chasing someone whose name we know, and we know where they live.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Oakland department, which is still working to repair its troubled history, now prohibits </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> from chasing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">suspects</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> alone into yards or alleys if they might be </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> receive training that emphasizes smart decision-making. After averaging about eight </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shootings annually for many years, the city had none last year and cut in half the number of times </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> drew their guns, Chief Whent said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Whether a shooting is justified often hinges on the fraction of a second before the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> fires. In Cleveland in November, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> thought that 12-year-old Tamir Rice was wielding a pistol, not realizing he was playing with a replica. In Ferguson, Mo., an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said he killed Michael Brown, 18, last summer because Mr. Brown had lunged at him after a scuffle through the window of his cruiser. In Seattle, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who shot the woodcarver said that the man had refused to drop his knife and that he had struck a ''very confrontational posture.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But earlier decisions can also be critical. In Cleveland, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> pulled their cars extremely close to Tamir, immediately increasing the possibility of a confrontation. In Ferguson, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Darren Wilson, got out of his car after the tussle and pursued Mr. Brown alone. In Seattle, internal investigators chastised the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ian Birk, for approaching the armed man and then using the 21-foot rule to justify shooting him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Birk created the situation which he claims he had to use deadly force to get out of,'' a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> review board concluded. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> resigned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York announced a new training program for the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Department in December as the city faced waves of protests over the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man who died after a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> chokehold. Seattle, which is under federal supervision after a Justice Department civil rights investigation, recently announced that its </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would also receive new training.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Tueller, the retired Salt Lake City instructor, said that he supported improving </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> training, but that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were being unfairly blamed for the recent spate of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">fatal</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shootings. Most, if not all, would have been avoided if the suspects had obeyed orders, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We can't get in people's heads, and we can't change behavior in many situations,'' he said. ''If they don't comply, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has to have options. De-escalation is fine, to a point.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Teaching </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to hesitate, Mr. Tueller said, could put them in danger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That focus on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> safety has underpinned many </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> policies, but Mr. Wexler argues that it is a false choice. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Britain, most of whom do not carry guns and typically face fewer suspects with firearms than some American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> do, regularly confront suspects carrying knives, as do their counterparts here. British </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> follow what is known as the National Decision Model, which emphasizes talking, remaining patient and using no more force than necessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  No </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in England has died from a weapon attack during the past two years, according to the most recent published data, and none have been involved in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">fatal</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shootings during that period. (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with guns back up those who do not carry them.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Mr. Wexler acknowledged that changes in policing would be slow. ''Not everybody's going to accept it,'' he said. ''We're asking them to rethink in a major way things they have done for 20 years.''</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">June 30--MT. JULIET -- An armed robbery Saturday evening at the Corner Market at 20 Benders Ferry Road remained under investigation Monday after the suspect was later found dead.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mt. Juliet </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> responded to an armed robbery call at about 8:30 p.m. at the Corner Market after a witness called 911. But before </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could get there, the suspect fled the scene in a Ford Escape after apparently stealing a case of beer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Investigators with the criminal investigations division responded to the scene. Their preliminary investigation revealed a man entered the store, grabbed a case of beer and ran out of the store. A 56-year-old clerk and 46-year-old witness confronted the suspect as he got into his car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the confrontation, the suspect pulled a revolver and pointed it at the clerk and witness. As the suspect fled the scene, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said the witness told them the suspect fired one gunshot out of the vehicle. No one was hit by gunfire or injured during the robbery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At about 10:30 p.m., Mt. Juliet </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> investigators confirmed the suspect was found dead at a home on Lakeview Drive in an unincorporated area of Wilson County. Wilson County </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">sheriff's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> investigators continued to look into the suspect's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sheriff</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Robert Bryan said </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deputies</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> responded to 62 Lakeview Drive on Saturday at about 11 p.m. and found Kristopher Lee Green dead in the home from what appeared to be a gunshot wound. Bryan said a small-caliber handgun was recovered from the scene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bryan said Green's body was taken to the state medical examiner's office for autopsy, and the investigation remained open pending the results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the investigation, Bryan said investigators found indications at the scene Green was a possible </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">suspect</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> robbery that prior to the shooting at the Corner Market at the corner of Benders Ferry Road and Lebanon Road in Mt. Juliet. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sheriff's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> investigators contacted Mt. Juliet </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and investigators from Mt. Juliet were investigating the armed robbery, Green and any possible connection between the two.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said there is no active search under way for any suspects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our thoughts and prayers go out to the suspect's family, friends and loved ones,&quot; said Mt. Juliet </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lt. Tyler Chandler. &quot;The identity of the suspect will not be released until the Wilson County </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sheriff's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Department completes [its] investigation.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> CAROLINE - A Virginia State Police trooper was seriously injured Wednesday morning after being hit by a vehicle while assisting with traffic control in Caroline County, according to state police Sgt. Steve Vick.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The trooper was hit at about 12:18 a.m. and taken to VCU Medical Center with serious but non-life-threatening injuries, Vick wrote in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The injured trooper was one of three troopers controlling traffic on southbound Interstate 95 near mile marker 108, north of the Ladysmith rest area, Vick said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A tractor trailer lost control while approaching the scene and hit a state police vehicle and then a contract worker's parked pickup truck, Vick said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Once the tractor trailer hit the pickup truck, the pickup truck hit the trooper, who was on foot, sending the trooper over a guardrail, Vick said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> State police were directing traffic because there was high water on the interstate, according to Vick, who said the police vehicles' emergency lights were on at the time of the crash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The contract worker was there to help the police, including by setting up cones, Vick said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The trooper was the only person injured, Vick said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nicholas J. Coia, 67, of Florida, was the driver of the 2016 Kenworth tractor trailer and was charged with reckless driving, Vick said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sheriff's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Office says the shooting happened early Wednesday morning on Fort Eustis Boulevard in York County while the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deputy</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was investigating a vehicle accident.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sheriff's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Office said Harrell, who was wanted for unspecified charges in another jurisdiction, had an extensive criminal history. It said Harrell was considered armed and dangerous with violent tendencies.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ST. LOUIS o St. Louis Circuit Attorney Jennifer Joyce announced Monday that no charges will be filed against the city </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who shot and killed VonDerrit Myers Jr.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joyce issued a press release and a report detailing an investigation her office conducted separately from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An assistant U.S. attorney helped with the investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joyce did not name the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in a 51-page report because he was not charged with a crime, but </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chief Sam Dotson released a separate statement including the name of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jason Flanery, which had become public months ago anyway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prosecutor's report on the Oct. 8 shooting reads, in part, &quot;Given all the available facts, witness statements, physical and forensic evidence&quot; prosecutors &quot;have determined a criminal violation could not be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Therefore, charges will not be filed in this case.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The material Joyce released suggested, in fact, that Flanery, 31, was attacked and shot Myers, 18, in self-defense while on patrol that night for a private residents' association in the Shaw neighborhood. The encounter occurred about 7:30 p.m. in the 4100 block of Shaw Boulevard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it did cast a new light on the beginnings of the incident, which Flanery had told investigators started when three youths ran from his marked security car, one of them holding his hand against his body as if securing a gun. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> did not catch them, and approached Myers shortly later, believing it was the same person.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Myers was wearing a GPS monitor on his ankle as a condition of his bail on charges from June 27 of unlawful use of a weapon and resisting arrest. &quot;Based on this GPS information, it appears Myers was not the person </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> X was chasing...&quot; the prosecutor's report says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It puts Myers at the Shaw Market, where he also is seen on video, and then going home briefly, where acquaintances said they went for jackets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> did have reason to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">suspect</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> from Myers' behavior in their encounter that he was </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the report says, and after they struggled had &quot;probable cause to give chase.&quot; It was during the foot pursuit, officials said, that Myers fired at least three shots before Flanery returned fire. Flanery was not hit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Flanery declined to be interviewed separately for Joyce's investigation, so his part of it was based on statements he made earlier to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> investigators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The circumstances of the killing of Myers, who was black, by Flanery, who is white, drew angry protests as it occurred just two months after international attention focused on the killing of Michael Brown, who was black, by a white Ferguson </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Aug. 9.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An attorney for the Myers family, Jerryl Christmas, challenged Joyce's report Monday and said he is close to filing a wrongful-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> lawsuit on their behalf.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Jason Flanery should have been charged with murder,&quot; Christmas said. &quot;The killing of VonDerrit was the same situation as the Walter Scott killing with the exception that (Myers' shooting) was not on video.&quot; His was referring to the killing of an unarmed man who fled a South Carolina </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who was charged with murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't believe for a minute that VonDerrit had a weapon,&quot; Christmas said. &quot;Flanery threw that gun down on him just like they threw that stun gun down on Walter Scott in South Carolina.&quot; The lawyer claimed a private autopsy showed that Myers was shot in the back while fleeing and fatally in the head as he lay wounded on the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked to account for photos circulated on social media of Myers in the past holding a gun that looked like the distinctive two-tone Smith &amp; Wesson pistol recovered at the scene, Christmas replied, &quot;Prosecutors can't say with any type of accuracy that's the same gun. All Smith &amp; Wessons look alike.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> initially described the confiscated gun as a Ruger, then changed it to Smith &amp; Wesson, saying it was an honest mistake made in haste to provide the public with answers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christmas and about three dozen others gathered at 6 p.m. Monday at a makeshift memorial where Myers died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm hurt because they took my grandbaby,&quot; Myers' grandmother Shelley Myers-Cotton told a reporter between sobs. She said the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;needs to be in the jailhouse,&quot; adding, &quot;Had it been me, I'd be in the jailhouse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Myers' mother, Syreeta Myers, said she was &quot;sick and tired&quot; of seeing black children killed by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joyce, the prosecutor, said that Myers' family attorneys never showed up for meetings, and neither provided access to witnesses they claimed disputed the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> statements nor a copy of the private autopsy. She said she issued grand jury subpoenas for three such witnesses, but one could not be found and the others cited Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mr. Christmas did not produce any witnesses to us who saw what happened,&quot; Joyce said in an interview. &quot;I have to assume that they did not have anything to offer that would have led to prosecuting the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or they would have come forward.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her report says, &quot;Based upon the investigation, prosecutors concluded that Mr. Myers produced a firearm on the evening in question. Multiple witnesses confirm there was gunfire coming from both directions and from two different guns at the scene. Ballistics evidence confirms that two different guns were fired at the scene. There is no evidence that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> X ... was the person who fired both guns.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It adds, &quot;No witness claims to have seen </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> X alter evidence in any way, such as throw down a gun, fire a weapon in any direction other than towards Mr. Myers or scatter bullet casings. Additionally, there are witnesses that describe how Mr. Myers illegally came into possession of the Smith and Wesson firearm used in this matter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In December, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> department said it found no criminal wrongdoing by Flanery. But under new procedures, the evidence still must be reviewed by the prosecutor for possible charges. Previously, prosecutors examined </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shootings only if the department asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state crime lab found gunshot residue on Myers' hands, shirt and inside the waistband and pockets of his jeans. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said such residue can be present on anyone near a shooting, but this was consistent with Myers firing a weapon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Joyce's investigation concluded that the residue was not proof either way. It also said it is &quot;rare&quot; to find DNA or fingerprints on a gun, and neither was found on this one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The location of bullets, casings, bullet tracks and damage are consistent with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> X's and other witnesses' versions of events,&quot; the report said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said three bullets matching the gun found with Myers had hit the ground near where Flanery said he tried to take cover. A round that pierced a car behind the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was too damaged for a match but not consistent with the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> bullets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dotson said Flanery has more than six years of service and was working an approved secondary job at the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We appreciate the community's patience as this investigation was conducted and commend the dedicated and thorough work of both the Circuit Attorney's Office and the Force Investigative Unit,&quot; Dotson wrote. &quot;I have pledged transparency to the citizens of St. Louis and am committed to upholding this promise.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protesters took to the streets of the Shaw neighborhood after Myers' </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The first night, rocks were thrown through windows of some homes and at least one business, three </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> vehicles were vandalized, and flags taken from porches were burned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Joyce's report, Flanery told investigators his reaction was slowed that night by thoughts of Ferguson: &quot;I didn't want to be wrong in my shoot. I knew it was a gun but, I just, I, I wanted to be certain. So I didn't shoot, I hesitated.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Flanery's attorney, Brian Millikan, said Monday: &quot;There's obviously a mix of emotions right now because it brings it all back up again.&quot; He added, &quot;We are relieved it's over and they concluded that no crime was committed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's what we expected. They obviously did a very thorough investigation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Millikan said Flanery became the subject of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> threats after Christmas made the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> name public months ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's certainly aware of his surroundings, let's put it that way,&quot; Millikan said. &quot;But he's continuing on with his normal job and doing it well and trying not to let this whole incident change his perspective on what he does.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the completion of the prosecutor's investigation into the Myers shooting, Joyce said she will turn her attention to a review of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">fatal</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shooting of Kajieme Powell on Aug. 19 by two city </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who said he came at them with a knife. A bystander's cellphone video included the sound of Powell shouting, &quot;Shoot me! Kill me now!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joyce said it is too soon to know how long that investigation would take.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People who knew the victim of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">fatal</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> May 20 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shooting at the Guelph General Hospital will honour him Monday with a pizza dinner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They will gather to remember Brandon Duncan at a downtown agency that serves local homeless and marginalized residents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, local political activists are planning to protest the use of lethal weapons by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ed Pickersgill co-ordinates 40 Baker St., which houses several programs and organizations that serve &quot;the unemployed, needy and dispossessed,&quot; according to its website. Duncan was a longtime client of Fresh Start Housing Centre. Fresh Start helps the homeless find shelter and sustainable housing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Duncan, 36, was killed in the emergency department at about 1:30 p.m. on May 20, during an interaction with two Guelph </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was shot multiple times. The SIU has 12 investigators probing the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Duncan suffered from mental illness, addiction, and Crohn's disease, according to friends and associates in the community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He accessed services for the homeless over at least a 15-year period, and had several lengthy stays in hospital related to Crohn's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pickersgill is dedicating the Monday pizza dinner at 40 Baker Street to Duncan. It runs from 4:15 p.m. to 5:15 p.m. People will be invited to share their thoughts and reactions on a large sheet of paper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the Facebook event page for the memorial, Pickersgill states Duncan was in &quot;a serious personal crisis resulting from homelessness, Crohn's, addiction, loneliness and fear,&quot; at the time of his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We at 40 Baker Street would like to share our pizza day supper on Monday 1st of June in memory of Brandon Duncan so that (1) his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> not go unmarked in his community; and (2) pizza and juice and music on that day be an occasion for those who knew him personally and for those who have shared in similar circumstances to have a chance to give a nod of understanding that his life did matter and that he simply should not have died the way he did.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Area funeral homes have been contacted and none is as yet managing memorial/burial arrangements for Duncan. The SIU would not comment this week on whether Duncan's body has been released for burial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's unclear where Duncan's next of kin reside. The SIU said a family member consented to release his name to the public. That person's identity has not been made public. Associates of Duncan in Guelph have asserted that they have no knowledge of him having relatives in the city. They believe he was raised in Fergus by his grandparents, who are deceased.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monday's event at 40 Baker Street may also involve planning for a protest at an upcoming Guelph </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Services Board meeting, said Sakura Saunders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saunders is a local political activist, a volunteer with the Ontario Public Interest Research Group, and a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> accountability activist. She is also the founder of the group Disarm Toronto </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and advocates for the disarming of front line </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said discussions are underway to organize a Guelph protest or advocacy event against the use of lethal force by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Activists are planning to attend a Guelph </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Service public meeting at the Shelldale Centre on Tuesday. That session is an input forum related to the development of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> service's next strategic business plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People are definitely disturbed about it,&quot; Saunders said, speaking of the Duncan shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have seen a number of cases (elsewhere) of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shooting people who were attempting self-harm or having mental health issues - coming in and shooting first and asking questions later,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">fatal</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shooting of Duncan was the first by a Guelph </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police officer,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Saunders said in the two years between August 2011 and August 2013, Toronto </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were engaged with 14 people who died. Seven of those were shot to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She said none of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">victims</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was as heavily </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed as the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is one of the reasons I advocate that front line </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are disarmed, and that only a special force has lethal weapons,&quot; she said, speaking of the Duncan incident. &quot;I think the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> should have been securing the area and making sure that people were safe, including the person they ended up killing, rather than using lethal means.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next meeting of the Guelph </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Services Board is June 18.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7"> BODY:<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People who knew the victim of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">fatal</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> May 20 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shooting at the Guelph General Hospital will honour him Monday with a pizza dinner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They will gather to remember Brandon Duncan at a downtown agency that serves local homeless and marginalized residents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, local political activists are planning to protest the use of lethal weapons by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ed Pickersgill co-ordinates 40 Baker Street, which houses several programs and organizations that serve &quot;the unemployed, needy and dispossessed,&quot; according to its website. Duncan was a longtime client of Fresh Start Housing Centre, which is located at 40 Baker St. Fresh Start helps the homeless find shelter and sustainable housing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Duncan, 36, was killed in the emergency department at about 1:30 p.m. on May 20, during an interaction with two Guelph </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police officers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He was shot multiple times. The Special Investigations Unit has been assigned to the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Duncan suffered from mental illness, addiction, and Crohn's disease, according to friends and associates in the community. He accessed services for the homeless over at least a 15-year period, and had several lengthy stays in hospital related to Crohn's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pickersgill is dedicating the Monday pizza dinner at 40 Baker St. to Duncan. It runs from 4:15 p.m. to 5:15 p.m. People will be invited to share their thoughts and reactions on a large sheet of paper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the Facebook event page for the memorial, Pickersgill states Duncan was in &quot;a serious personal crisis resulting from homelessness, Crohn's, addiction, loneliness and fear,&quot; at the time of his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We at 40 Baker Street would like to share our pizza day supper on Monday 1st of June in memory of Brandon Duncan so that (1) his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> not go unmarked in his community; and (2) pizza and juice and music on that day be an occasion for those who knew him personally and for those who have shared in similar circumstances to have a chance to give a nod of understanding that his life did matter and that he simply should not have died the way he did.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Area funeral homes have been contacted and none is as yet managing memorial/burial arrangements for Duncan. The SIU would not comment this week on whether Duncan's body has been released for burial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's unclear where Duncan's next of kin reside. The SIU said a family member consented to release his name to the public. That person's identity has not been made public. Associates of Duncan in Guelph have asserted that they have no knowledge of him having relatives in the city. They believe he was raised in Fergus by his grandparents, who are deceased.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monday's event may also involve planning for a protest at an upcoming Guelph </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Services Board meeting, said Sakura Saunders, a local political activist, a volunteer with the Ontario Public Interest Research Group, and a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> accountability activist. She is also the founder of the group Disarm Toronto </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and advocates for the disarming of front line </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said discussions are underway to organize a Guelph protest or advocacy event against the use of lethal force by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Activists are planning to attend a Guelph </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Service public meeting at the Shelldale Centre on Tuesday. That session is an input forum related to the development of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> service's next strategic business plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People are definitely disturbed about it,&quot; Saunders said, speaking of the Duncan shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have seen a number of cases (elsewhere) of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shooting people who were attempting self-harm or having mental health issues - coming in and shooting first and asking questions later,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">fatal</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shooting of Duncan was the first by a Guelph </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police officer,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Saunders said in the two years between August, 2011 and August, 2013, Toronto </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were engaged with 14 people who died. Seven of those were shot to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She said none of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">victims</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was as heavily </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed as the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next meeting of the Guelph </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Services Board is June 18.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An armed 74-year-old woman who held </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">sheriff</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> s </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deputies</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in a 22-hour standoff near Woodland Hills last week was fasting and had not slept for days when she suffered what one son called  a manic break. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a Tuesday afternoon news conference at Los Angeles County </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sheriff</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> s Department headquarters in Monterey Park, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">sheriff</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> s officials explained how an initial distress call of an elderly woman having difficulty breathing devolved into what </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sheriff</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jim McDonnell called  a life or </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> situation  for the woman and authorities.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Video: Family says woman had not shown signs of mental health issues</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The incident began about 5:30 a.m. Thursday when the woman placed a call for medical assistance from the Woodland Park Mobile Estates at 4201 Topanga Canyon Blvd., an unincorporated section of the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When a firefighter approached to ask the woman how he could help her, she pulled a gun and fled into the park.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sheriff</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> s </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deputies</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> later found her sitting in an alcove on the back porch of a home. That s when </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deputies</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sent in a robot to the area, said Lt. Bruce Chase.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chase said the woman fired two rounds at the robot, causing the department to try other tactics   tear gas, light and sound diversion, water and less lethal impact devices   to coax her out of hiding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nothing worked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We were trying to separate her from the gun,  Chase said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At one point, the woman burrowed underneath the home where she fired three additional rounds at authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She lived in another home at the park for about 10 years, according to family members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was 18 hours into the operation that the command staff decided no more chemical agents or less lethal impact devices should be used,  McDonnell said.  She has shown zero reaction to any of it and the cumulative effect of more could seriously injure or possibly kill her. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 3:30 a.m. Friday, five </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deputies</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were sent under the house to forcibly remove the woman. Only three of the five </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deputies</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were armed and none could wear any protective gear due to the small space.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the woman had one round left in her revolver.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We were prepared to use deadly force if we had to. It would have been extremely depressing to everybody involved ... if it had ended in the use of deadly force,  Chase said.  In this particular case, ... they were going head first against an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed suspect</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with no tactical protection. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chase declined to comment on what exactly occurred beneath the home but said the woman was handcuffed and taken into custody without incident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The woman has not been charged and was still being treated Tuesday for a hand injury at Northridge Hospital Medical Center. She initially suffered from hypothermia following the overnight incident. No one else was injured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her two sons, who declined to be identified, said she had never exhibited signs of mental health issues prior to the incident. It wasn t until an email she sent to her sons on Wednesday night that they realized something was wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She went down all these different threads, was never able to come back on track and said she was writing a book that would change the world,  her elder son said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two planned to check on her that weekend, not imagining what would unfold over the next 24 hours. Neither son knew she had a gun, they said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fortunately she was physically tough enough to endure a situation that she put herself in,  one son said.  We re so proud of the whole team of law enforcement for their restraint and compassion. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7"> BODY:<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had just shot and killed an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unarmed</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> minority </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">suspect</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who had been trying to flee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A fellow </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> dashboard camera caught the aftermath.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Grant Morrison walks away from the scene of the shooting, his head in his hand, reaches the side of his colleague's cruiser, and collapses, sobbing uncontrollably.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For minutes on end, all that can be heard on the video is a fellow </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> repeating, over and over, &quot;I've got you.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barely able to speak, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Morrison stammers, &quot;I thought he was going to pull a gun on me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A colleague leans over, consolingly, and whispers. &quot;Maybe he was, maybe he was.... You survived.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The actions of a Billings, Mont., </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> bear little relation with whatever transpired before and after Freddie Gray was loaded, handcuffed and unbuckled, into a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> van in Baltimore weeks ago. Mr. Gray died a week later of a severe neck injury suffered while in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> custody.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Montana dashcam video offers at least a glimpse into why many </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> look at the indictment of six </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Friday in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of Gray with no small amount of trepidation.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For years, prosecutors and the United States Supreme Court have given </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> wide leeway in their use of deadly force. Now, the terms of that societal contract are up for robust debate, at the very least. If they are to change - as protesters from Ferguson, Mo., to North Charleston, S.C., have demanded - the question is how much?&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> agree they must be held accountable to the law. But they wonder if society recognizes the difficulty of the task they are often set, and whether in the anger of the present the pendulum of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> reform could swing too far the other way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The big picture is that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are always held accountable for what elected officials can't provide for the people - for failed infrastructure and failed policy,&quot; retired Baltimore </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Leon Taylor told Slate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Baltimore, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were tasked with holding the line between impoverished West Baltimore and the gentrifying urban core. Whether the tactics Baltimore </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have used are necessary to maintain law and order will be addressed - either directly or implicitly - in the trial of the six </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ran afoul of the law, many fellow </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> nationwide will want to see them held responsible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;First of all, the fundamental purpose of law enforcement is to bring violators of the law to justice, even if those violators of the law are law enforcement themselves,&quot; Dana Schrad, executive director for the Virginia Chiefs of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Association, told WBT-TV in Richmond, Va. &quot;The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will have their day in court and justice will be based on the evidence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there is a sense among some </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that society does not appreciate the complexities and mental toll of a job where the ability to deal out </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is holstered on your hip, and the authority to do it is a badge pinned to your chest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The public thinks the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are above the law, but the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> see themselves as expendable,&quot; former </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Taylor told Slate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Montana case, Morrison killed Richard Ramirez at a traffic stop in April 2014. After being told several times to put his hands up, Mr. Ramirez, who was high on methamphetamines, reached into his waistband, Morrison told a jury at a coroner's inquest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I knew in that moment, which later was determined to be untrue, but I knew in that moment that he was reaching for a gun,&quot; Morrison said, according to Yahoo News. &quot;I couldn't take that risk.... I wanted to see my son grow up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 2011 reaction-time study found that if an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> waits until an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed suspect</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> raises his gun to shoot, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">suspect</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will likely get off the first shot. The Montana jury found that Morrison was justified in shooting Ramirez.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fallout from Ferguson, however, has begun to change the calculus of policing. An Ohio </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> won national praise for not shooting a murder suspect despite the fact that the man charged him with his hand in his pocket, telling the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to shoot him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moreover, some </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> departments are working to open a dialogue with the black community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'd much rather they shout at me at a town hall meeting at a church and get to know me afterward than not have a relationship,&quot; Dallas </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chief David Brown told the Associated Press. After a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shooting has already happened, &quot;it's too late to try to establish relationships.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The concern is that the passion of the moment could lead to a reverse prejudice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In my 20-year career as a law enforcement </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and 16 years as an attorney I have never seen such a rush to file criminal charges, which I believe are driven by forces separate and apart from the application of law and the facts of this case as we've heard them,&quot; Michael Davey, a lawyer for one of the Baltimore </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> told the media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ultimately, however, those </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will have to explain themselves, some </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Unfortunately I have to agree with the decision,&quot; Joseph Giacalone, a retired New York </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Department detective sergeant, told Slate. &quot;Because I have no answer to why they threw him into the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> van in the first place. What was the charge? Why did they arrest him? He didn't commit any crime.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of the guys I've spoken to feel the same thing I do.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Did you see or hear anything suspicious in Vicarage Road on Saturday? If you did then we want to hear from you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Ward also confirmed what is believed to be the murder weapon was found at the property in Vicarage Road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whilst post mortem examinations are yet to be carried out, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have said they believe the victims were stabbed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Ward also issued a warning to anyone sheltering Allen, 21.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;If you don't want to speak directly to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or online at www.crimestoppers-uk.org. No personal details are taken, information is not traced or recorded and you will not go to court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If anyone is harbouring Jed Allen then you need to know that this is a serious offence and we would ask you to contact us immediately.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Ward added:&nbsp;&quot;At this time no arrests have been made in this investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The post mortems of the victims are scheduled to take place today (25/5) and tomorrow (26/5).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our search of Oxford University Parks continues today with more than 100 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> involved, including national specialist search </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who have now joined the search.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I can confirm that what we believe to be the murder weapon was found at the scene of the murder in Vicarage Road, Didcot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Finally, I would like to thank all those members of the public who have called in with information, as well as the media who have published our appeals.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">12:59pm</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> release two CCTV images of Jed Allen taken at the WH Smith store at Oxford Station at just before 6pm on Saturday - little more than two hours before Jan, Phil and Derin's bodies were discovered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More on this shortly</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">12:46pm</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tributes and bouquets continue to be left at Vicarage Road</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">12:45pm</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> remain at the house in Vicarage Road where Jan Jordon, Philip Howard and Derin Jordon were discovered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11:50am</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have yet to issue any new information about the investigation so far</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11:40am</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Myers, the headteacher at All Saint's Primary School where Derin was in Year 1, said the family had just moved, but had most of their connections in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Myers said: &quot;She was a beautiful little girl, happy and gentle and smiley. She was a wonderful little child.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he felt &quot;shocked and devastated&quot;, adding: &quot;As you can suspect I was just shocked when I heard. It's hard to believe, but it's also the manner of it as well. To lose any life is awful and lose a child is doubly so. But the nature of this loss is hard to take in and comprehend.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People have now gathered at the Ladygrove Children's Centre at the school, which is due to be open until 3pm today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Myers added: &quot;I was here yesterday afternoon talking with friends and we just thought we needed to offer a place for people to go.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People need a place to gather at times like this. We thought we should open up our doors and offer tea and coffee and a vicar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have tea lights and candles and people can pray and there's gentle music.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11:25am</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10:00am</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A RAINBOW of ribbons will be spread across Didcot as the town pulls together after a family of three were found murdered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are still hunting for Jed Allen, 21, after the bodies of his mother Jan Jordon, her partner Philip Howard and their six-year-old daughter Derin were found in their Vicarage Road home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Flowers and tributes are being left at a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cordon on the street, barely yards from the murder scene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today Didcot's Ladygrove Children's Centre at All Saint's School, where Derin was a pupil, will be open from 10am until 3pm for families to gather with their children in support and remembrance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Multi-coloured ribbons are also being tied around lamp posts in the area as a tribute to the three.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The main colours being chosen are blue for Mr Howard, purple or red for Ms Jordon and pink for six-year-old Derin, who was known affectionately as &quot;Dezzy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cordon remains on Vicarage Road, but Oxford University Parks has reopened after </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> closed it off yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A full-scale manhunt, involving more than 100 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was launched as Allen was named as a suspect in the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said the most likely cause of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was stabbing, and post mortem examinations are expected to be carried out today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Searches in Didcot and Oxford are expected to continue today as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> unravel what happened to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">victims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> descended on University Parks in Oxford as part of the investigation. The parks' gates were shut and the grounds remained closed for most of the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This morning the gates were unlocked and the park appeared to have reopened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Flowers and cuddly toys have been left on the cordon in Didcot, just yards from the crime scene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A tribute signed by Mary, Dilly and Mally started: &quot;To my best friend Jan, Dezzy &amp; my anorexic Phil &amp; my gorgeous boy Jed,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You are my family &amp; always will be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I always said Jan you were too kind for this world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My heart is broken &amp; will never be the same again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How the investigation developed over Saturday and Sunday</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Det Supt Chris Ward said the most likely cause of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deaths</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of the&nbsp;trio - whose bodies were found in their home in Vicarage Road just before 8.30pm on Saturday - was stabbing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neighbours in Didcot have told the Oxford Mail that Allen regularly stayed at the family's previous address in Wensum Drive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Howard was 44, Ms Jordon 48 and Derin six and&nbsp;Mr Ward said: &quot;We offer our condolences to the family. This is obviously a tragic and sad event.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Ward, of Thames Valley </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> major crime unit, said </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were hunting for Allen, 21, as the force released a picture of him and appealed for anyone who sees him to call them on 101.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that post mortem examinations will be carried out today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were called to the property just before 8.30pm on Saturday</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paramedics declared all three people dead at the scene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one has been arrested and more than 100 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are now involved in the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At about 4.25pm yesterday a private ambulance pulled up at the scene and the three bodies were brought out of&nbsp;the property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> arrive at Oxford University Parks and put on riot gear</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in riot gear, along with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> dogs, were yesterday seen entering Oxford University Parks after the grounds were shut as part of the investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An armed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was also seen walking through the park.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 20 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were seen entering the park in two large </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> vans at the South Lodge car park, by St Cross Street. A blue tent has been put up by that entrance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All were carrying riot shields and they marched northwards into the grounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The gates were locked and a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> helicopter was seen hovering over the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are hunting for Jed Allen in connection with a triple murder in Didcot</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A lot of activity appeared to be happening toward the north-east end of the grounds, near the River Cherwell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Passers-by were told by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Oxford University security </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that the parks would be shut all day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roland Rossler, 44, a tourist from Hamburg, said: &quot;I just came down to university parks this morning and I was told they are shut.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I heard there is a murder and now </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are looking for someone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's very worrying.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at the gates of Oxford University Parks</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> confirmed that Allen was once a groundskeeper for Oxford Univeristy and Didcot Town Council's website lists a man of the same name having been an apprentice gardener with the authority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a press conference yesterday morning, Mr Ward appealed for the public's help to find Allen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;It is very important that we locate him as quickly as we can.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I do not believe that there are any dangers to the wider community of Oxford, however given the nature of what we are dealing with, it's imporatnt that we find him as quickly and safely as possible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Allen is 21, of large build, white, and has a distinctive tattoo of a spider on his left hand, Mr Ward said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was related to the victims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Allen was formerly a groundsman for Oxford University, Mr Ward said, and there are searches going on in relation to that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His Facebook page says he studied at Marlborough School. He came from Didcot but now lives in Oxford, the page also says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Ward said claims that a firearm was involved in their </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deaths</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were not true but added: &quot;I do not want to speculate at the cause of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at the moment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know how long the victims were [dead in the house] but we are concentrating on the last 24 hours.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their families&nbsp;had been informed of their </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deaths,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Ward added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three people had moved in to the house only within the past two months but had lived in the area before that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Ward is now appealing for anyone who was in Vicarage Road in the past 24 hours to call detectives on 101 quoting a new reference number of 465 (24/5).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The road is now sealed off as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> carry out their investigations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three scenes of crime </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were seen going into the house about 8.15am&nbsp; yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were at least 12 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at the scene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> held a press conference at 10.30am and we will be covering it live as it happens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A former landlady of Ms Jordon said that she had known the 48-year-old and Allen when they rented a house from her in Kidlington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jane Ilott, 68, said: &quot;I didn't know Jed as a 6ft man, I know him as a little fella who was really struggling.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pensioner explained that her 48-year-old former tenant was not the kind of person that you got to know well, and that she moved into one of her houses before moving to Didcot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He lived with his dad and he was a lovely, lovely boy. He would come down some weekends, he would either be with his nan, who lives in Kidlington, or with his mum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She continued: &quot;We did far more than a landlord and landlady would have done, we tried to be good neighbours.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked if there was a man in Ms Jordon's life when she was living in Kidlington, Mrs Illot said: &quot;I used to get knocks on the door, little disagreements with people knocking on my door and asking for the keys and I would say 'No'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adding that she would turn them away even when they claimed that Ms Jordon had said it was ok for them to go in, Mrs Ilott said: &quot;That would be one of many, I'm only being honest. I'm not saying she was a nasty girl because she wasn't, she was a lovely girl with a problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Det Chief Insp Simon Steel of the Thames Valley </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Major Crime Unit, said: &quot;Thames Valley </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has launched a murder investigation in Didcot after receiving a call from a member of the public at 8.23pm yesterday (23/5).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> attended the scene and three bodies were found inside the property. A man, a woman and a girl were pronounced dead at the scene by ambulance staff. Their </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deaths</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are being treated as suspicous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a tragic incident and our thoughts are with the loved&nbsp;ones of the deceased.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would like to reassure the public that we are carrying out a thorough investigation into the incident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We would urge anyone with any information about the incident to contact us immediately via 101 quoting reference number 1370 (23/5). Did you see or hear anything suspicious in Vicarage Road this evening? If you did then we want to hear from you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you don't want to speak directly to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111 or online at www.crimestoppers-uk.org.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No personal details are taken, information is not traced or recorded and you will not go to court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A scene watch is in place in Vicarage Road, which is currently closed with access to residents only.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I understand this incident will have an impact on the community and residents will be concerned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you can understand, we are in the early stages of this investigation, but we will work hard to make sure the community is kept updated when we can.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman from South Central Ambulance Service said: &quot;We were called at 8.33pm to an incident in Vicarage Road, in Didcot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We sent two ambulance crews, an ambulance </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and our Enhanced Care Response Unit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sadly, three people were confirmed deceased at the scene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;An adult male, an adult female and a child.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7"> BODY:<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> US Department of Justice, The Government of USA has issued the following news release: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thank you, Steve [Edwards, Executive Director of the Institute of Politics], for inviting me here today. It's an honor to speak with you about the work of the Civil Rights Division, particularly our work to ensure that policing is done in accordance with the Constitution and to help local </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> departments and the communities they serve build trust where it has eroded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eric Garner. Tamir Rice. John Crawford. Walter Scott. Freddie Gray.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These names and many others have become familiar to us under tragic circumstances in recent months. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deaths</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and those of other unarmed African-American men and women in encounters with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have provoked widespread responses across the country and have fueled the Black Lives Matter movement. In communities of color, in particular, the reaction has been stark and sobering. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the seven months I have been at the Civil Rights Division, I have spent a lot of time with local leaders and community members in cities all across America, including with numerous mothers who have lost their children in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-involved shootings. The pain, anger, frustration--the lack of trust in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">--is real, and it is profound. Again and again, people have told me that young people are losing faith in our justice system and view law enforcement as preying on them rather than protecting their loved ones. They talk about how the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> don't value their rights, or indeed, their lives. They talk about being tired of being viewed as criminals first, human beings second.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conversation in these rooms, however, is not about whether to have </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or not, but about what kind of policing communities want and deserve. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no question that we need </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in our communities. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ensure the safety of our communities by patrolling neighborhoods, defending the rights of victims and deterring crime. They are our first responders in many emergency situations. And they can be role models for our young people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The overwhelming majority of the women and men who </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> our streets do their jobs with honor, pride and distinction. Most of these individuals are driven to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> academy out of a commitment to public service and a desire to make an impact in their communities. As we are reminded by the senseless and tragic assassinations of New York </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Department (NYPD) Detectives Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu in December, the shooting of two </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Ferguson in March, and the tragic injuries inflicted on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Baltimore a few weeks ago, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> do all of this at considerable risk to themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am struck everywhere I go by the wide gap in empathy and common language to discuss these problems. Because in the very same cities and rooms where I speak with folks in the community, I hear from law enforcement who emphasize their responsibility to enforce the law and how they are doing the best job they can. They feel attacked and undervalued. They talk about how the actions of a few bad actors have tarnished the whole profession. They talk about the fact that department budgets have been slashed over the last several years, resulting in drastic cuts for community policing and neighborhood patrols. They point out that they are constantly making split second decisions and people don't account for the thousands of times situations don't escalate. They talk about how the daily stress of their jobs takes a toll. And they are right about all of this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite these divergent themes, there is one commonality in all rooms I am in. And that is that everyone agrees that we are confronting grave challenges when it comes to the erosion of trust between </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the communities they serve throughout the United States. The level of mistrust and resentment is unsettling. Some, including NYPD Commissioner William Bratton, call it a &quot;crisis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The consequences of distrust between law enforcement and the communities they serve can be devastating. Where people perceive the criminal justice system to be arbitrary, biased and unfair, they are less likely to cooperate with law enforcement, making us all less safe. The distrust and alienation experienced in some communities can build into a powder keg of resentment, ready to be ignited by a single tragic incident. We have seen this over and over--in Watts in 1965, in Los Angeles in 1992 and most recently, in Ferguson in 2014.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's worth asking, first, how did we get here? And second, what are we going to do about it? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's start with the first question and consider the source of the mistrust. Mistrust can't be explained away as the kneejerk reaction of the ill-informed or the hyperbolic. It has many sources. For some people, it's in part the product of historical awareness about the role that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> played, as Commissioner Bratton recently told a group of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in &quot;slavery, Reconstruction, Jim Crow, lynchings, blockbusting.&quot; FBI Director James Comey has likewise noted, &quot;At many points in American history, law enforcement enforced the status quo, a status quo that was often brutally unfair to disfavored groups.&quot; As Commissioner Bratton explained, this history has an enduring effect. &quot;None of us did these things,&quot; he told his audience of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;None of us were troopers on the bridge at Selma. But it doesn't matter that these things happened before many of us were even born. What matters is that our history follows us like a second shadow.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mistrust is also the product of lived experience, of negative interactions that individuals - or their family members, friends or neighbors - have had with law enforcement. Something as quietly humiliating as being mistreated during a traffic stop, or being followed in a retail store. These stories can circulate through a neighborhood - or these days, across the nation via the web and social media - and they can build up over time into a painful narrative that divides community members and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lack of trust also undeniably results from our criminal justice policies over the last few decades, and the concentrated impact they have had on communities of color and people living in poverty. Law enforcement practices such as the stopping and frisking of young black men based on stereotypes. Sentencing policies that result in mass incarceration, particularly of people of color. And the devastating consequences that convictions have had on individuals' ability to find work, secure stable housing and reintegrate as full members of society. We bear the responsibility to confront these consequences and reevaluate our approach to criminal justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Civil Rights Division's investigation and March 2015 report on the Ferguson </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Department (FPD) speaks to much of what I have been talking about.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Ferguson, we found a community where unlawful </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> practices created an intensely charged atmosphere where people feel under siege by those charged to serve and protect them. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We determined that the FPD engages in a pattern or practice of conduct that violates the United States Constitution and federal law. Specifically, we found that Ferguson PD routinely:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Conducts stops without reasonable suspicion and arrests without probable cause, in violation of the Fourth Amendment;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Uses excessive force in violation of the Fourth Amendment;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unlawfully interferes with First Amendment rights, including the right to record and to protest </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> activity;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Impermissibly discriminates against African Americans in violation of the 14th Amendment and federal statutory law; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Violates due process and equal protection in the operation of its Municipal Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We found that this unconstitutional conduct stems from the interaction of two dynamics: Ferguson's undue focus on revenue generation through policing and pervasive racial bias in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> department and court system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These dynamics fostered unconstitutional practices at nearly every level of Ferguson's law enforcement system. One example: During the summer of 2012, a Ferguson </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> detained a 32-year-old African-American man who had just finished playing basketball at a park. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> approached while the man was sitting in his car, cooling off. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The car's windows appeared to be more heavily tinted than Ferguson's code allowed, so the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> may have had grounds to question him. But, with no apparent justification, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> proceeded to escalate the situation, accusing the man of being a pedophile. He prohibited the man from using his cell phone and ordered him out of his car for a pat-down search, even though he had no reason to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">suspect</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that the man was </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And when the man objected - citing his constitutional rights - the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> drew his gun, pointed it at the man's head and arrested him on eight different counts. The arrest caused the man to lose his job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We observed that even minor code violations can sometimes result in multiple arrests, jail time and payments that exceed the cost of the original ticket many times over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, in 2007, one woman received two parking tickets that - together - totaled $152. To date, she has paid $550 in fines and fees to the city of Ferguson. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She's been arrested twice for having unpaid tickets and she has spent six days in jail. Yet she still - inexplicably - owes Ferguson $541. Her story is only one of dozens of similar accounts that our investigation uncovered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Ferguson, we also found evidence of unlawful discrimination. African Americans make up 67 percent of the population, but from 2012 to 2014, they constituted:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 85 percent of the people subject to a vehicle stop;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 90 percent of people who received a citation; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 93 percent of people arrested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And discretionary </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> actions were overwhelmingly concentrated on the black population. To take just one example, 95 percent of &quot;manner of walking in roadway&quot; charges - that's jaywalking - were levied against African Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We found racial disparities in virtually every available metric. From 2012 to 2014, African Americans were more than twice as likely as white drivers to be searched during vehicle stops, but 26 percent less likely to be found in possession of contraband. In 88 percent of cases in which FPD documented the use of force, force was used against African Americans. In all cases in which canines were used against subjects for whom racial information is available, the subject was African-American.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The evidence of racial bias comes not only from statistics, but also from remarks made by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and court supervisors in disturbing email messages. The emails were incontrovertible evidence of a culture infected by racial bias.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These findings reveal that the public trust in Ferguson law enforcement and its criminal justice system, especially among African Americans, was damaged long before August 2014. When there is this level of broad community distrust, public safety suffers and the job of delivering </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> services is rendered more difficult and more dangerous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In many ways, Ferguson is not an anomaly. We know from our work around the country that some of the same </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and court practices that we identified in Ferguson - and the same deficit of trust between </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and communities - exist in many other places. Local officials recognize this, as well. I know of several </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> chiefs around the country who have assigned the report as required reading for their </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And in light of the report, cities around the country are beginning to re-examine their policing and municipal court practices. Undoubtedly, there is much more work to do, but there's also much to be hopeful about.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In many communities, thoughtful </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and city leaders are working to re-prioritize community policing and rebuild community trust. Take Cleveland. Mayor Frank Jackson asked the Civil Rights Division to investigate the Cleveland Division of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (CDP) in March 2013. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In December 2014, we announced the results of our investigation, concluding that Cleveland </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> engage in a pattern or practice of unreasonable and unnecessary force, including deadly force such as shootings and head strikes with impact weapons. We also found that the pattern of excessive force had eroded public confidence in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thanks to the commitment of Mayor Jackson, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chief Calvin Williams, the city's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> unions and community members, we entered into a negotiated reform agreement a mere five months after issuing our initial report. The agreement takes the form of a consent decree that will be independently monitored and enforceable in court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a truly innovative and comprehensive agreement. It addresses </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> needs by requiring CDP to develop an Equipment and Resource Plan to ensure that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have the equipment they need - such as computers and safe vehicles - to do their jobs safely. It calls for additional training and an effective employee assistance program to give </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ready access to mental health and support resources. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It sets up a new Community </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Commission - made up of 10 civilian representatives from across the city and one member from each of the city's three </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> unions - that will work with the Division of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to improve community policing, bias-free policing and transparency. Through this body, the Cleveland community will play a central role in the development of many important </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">polices,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> including those related to use of force and search and seizure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agreement also calls for:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A civilian head of Internal Affairs, to ensure that internal investigations of misconduct are impartial and reliable;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Specialized training in interacting with persons in mental health crisis, and a Mental Health Response Advisory Committee to foster relationships between the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the community and mental health providers;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Revised use-of-force policies and training that will require </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to use de-escalation techniques, rather than force, wherever possible;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Strengthened reporting and supervision requirements, along with broad data collection; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many other provisions aimed at promoting public safety and building trust between the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Cleveland agreement reflects a commitment by the City and the Division of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to work with the Cleveland community to transform this </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> agency into a model of community-oriented policing. The agreement also demonstrates that people can come together across perceived differences to realize a common vision of a safer, more just city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Baltimore is another city in which local officials are stepping up to tackle longstanding divisions and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-community divisions. Last month, Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake asked us to investigate the Baltimore </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Department for a pattern or practice of civil rights violations. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That same day, the City's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> commissioner and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> union released statements agreeing with the Mayor's request and welcoming our involvement. Gene Ryan, President of the Baltimore City Fraternal Order of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lodge No. 3, released a statement stating that the union intends to &quot;fully cooperate with any investigation that has the potential to correct departmental deficiencies and improve the morale of our members . . . As the labor union that represents the nearly 3,000 active duty members of the agency, we agree with (the) Mayor on her invitation to the Department of Justice and welcome their investigation fully as we, too, have issues with many of the current policies and procedures of the department.&quot; After considering the relevant factors, we accepted the City's invitation and opened an investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wherever this investigation may lead - we don't know what we'll find, and we will never prejudge any outcome - our goal is to work with the community, public officials, law enforcement </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> unions to help build a stronger, better Baltimore. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As events in both Cleveland and Baltimore show, the commitment of all of these local actors is essential if we are to move forward. To restore trust where it has been badly eroded. To promote healing - and address problems that are common to so many great cities across America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I said there were two questions - what the sources of mistrust are and what we are going to do about it. The second question is hard, but we have an unprecedented opportunity now to address fundamental problems in the way communities across the country interact with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and with the criminal justice system more generally. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the Civil Rights Division and others in this room and beyond have been working on policing issues for many years, the nation is paying attention because communities are demanding it. The reality is we tend to confront systemic problems only when forced to by seemingly extraordinary events. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Journalists now are doing impressive investigative reporting on excessive force, racial profiling and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-community relations. Universities are doing important research and analysis of these problems. And families are talking about them at the dinner table.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Importantly, the focus on policing issues is happening in a broader conversation about the need to reform our criminal justice system. There is no question, and I speak from personal experience, that 15 years ago, criminal justice reform was a lonely endeavor. Few on the Left or the Right were willing to champion its cause. Today, there is a widespread, even bipartisan, recognition that our criminal justice system needs an overhaul that it should not be the go-to answer for social problems and that mass incarceration has damaged this country in countless ways. Law enforcement leaders themselves talk about how they have become first responders for a whole host of social problems, including homelessness, mental illness, drug dependency and school discipline. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is now growing consensus that in too many places, the only response we have made available to these challenges is arrest and incarceration as opposed to evidence-based, alternative interventions. There is real reform taking place on these broader criminal justice issues right now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For these reasons, we should be optimistic about this moment. The public is engaged and there is an opportunity for real progress. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is the work ahead? At the Civil Rights Division, we have redoubled our efforts to ensure that policing is done in accordance with the Constitution and to help local </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> departments and the communities they serve build trust where it has eroded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We can and do prosecute individual </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for intentional misconduct. In fact, we have prosecuted nearly 400 law enforcement </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> over just the last six years for constitutional violations. This includes our joint prosecution with the Chicago U.S. Attorney's Office of former Chicago </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Department Commander Jon Burge in 2010 on perjury and obstruction charges, relating to the torture and abuse of detainees in the 1980s. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Criminal prosecution, however, is only one tool, and a limited one at that. We also engage in systemic reform of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> departments, like in Ferguson and Cleveland. Since the start of the administration, the Division has opened 22 investigations into </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> departments. We have also entered into 17 agreements with law enforcement agencies, including consent decrees in New Orleans; Puerto Rico; Seattle; Portland, Oregon; Detroit; the Virgin Islands; East Haven, Connecticut; Warren, Ohio; Albuquerque, New Mexico; and Los Angeles. The department currently has eight open investigations. In the majority of these investigations the Division has issued findings or technical assistance letters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As discussed above, the Division is often invited into communities with the support of elected officials, law enforcement, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> unions and communities. Working together with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and community members, we are helping to change the way </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> services are delivered, to reduce the use of unnecessary force and to combat the influence of racial and ethnic bias in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> decision making. We call the last five years of our work in this area &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reform 2.0&quot; because we learned a lot from the first 15 years of enforcement and we have incorporated lessons learned from that first decade and a half into our more recent efforts. &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reform 2.0&quot; entails exhaustive engagement with the community through individual interviews and town hall meetings. We meet with local officials and civil rights leaders. We learn from law enforcement leaders. And we spend a lot of time speaking with line </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers and with police unions</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Too often, they tell us that they lack adequate support, training, policy guidance, supervision and even equipment to keep them safe and allow them to engage in constitutional policing that keeps them and the public safe. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even after we announce our findings, we continue intensive engagement with all of the various stakeholders, including community leaders, line </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers and police unions</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to help shape the remedies that we negotiate at arm's length with city officials. In Ferguson, we have met with several community groups and held an open community forum to learn how area residents wanted to see their </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> department and court system change. Several weeks ago, our attorneys facilitated small group discussions, standing at oversized notepads with marker in hand, taking down the groups' ideas. In our view, this is how reform starts. The stakeholders must feel investment in the remedies laid out in our agreements for them to be successful and sustainable. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Through this inclusive approach to reform, we have identified certain elements that are absolutely required to build trust and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> legitimacy where they have eroded. For example, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> commanders must create opportunities for line </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to have positive interactions, outside of the enforcement context, with individuals they may encounter as victims, witnesses or subjects. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a fundamental component of community policing. Departments must also commit to transparency, because the more communities know about </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> activity, the more operations can reflect community values and priorities. Structured community engagement is vital - there are a host of models for that and I know you will be having a panel about civilian oversight. We need better research and data. There is a lot we don't know that we should, so thoughtful data collection and analysis is a priority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There must be fair, consistent and robust internal and external systems of accountability so that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> departments can course correct when problems are identified. Improper bias - both explicit and implicit bias - must be identified and corrected. Critically, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> must be given the specialized training to do their jobs consistent with community values and the professional support to cope with stress and trauma they encounter on the job. They need training to ensure de-escalation with the mentally ill and others in crisis, as well as to ensure respectful interactions with LGBTI, immigrants with language barriers and other vulnerable populations. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And procedural justice matters. Research shows that being treated fairly and respectfully matters more than the ultimate result of a person's interaction with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We build these concepts into all of our consent decrees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the past three years, the Division has successfully concluded the implementation of three consent decrees, as well as a memorandum of agreement. Most recently, on May 11, 2015, the Division and the U.S. Attorney's Office announced that the Missoula, Montana, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Department had fully implemented the requirements of its agreement with the department to improve its response to reports of sexual assault. The Missoula </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Department's successful implementation of the agreement in just two years illustrates the power of government, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and community leaders working together to create change that makes law enforcement and communities safer and stronger. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Civil Rights Division is trying to address problems in policing from every angle. For example, our Educational Opportunities Section is working to disrupt the school-to-prison pipeline by intervening where school discipline practices are overly punitive and disproportionately enforced against students of color. Our Employment Litigation Section has brought suits around the country to end discrimination in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hiring. And our Federal Coordination and Compliance Section is working to ensure that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and court services are available to those with limited English proficiency. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The department, and indeed the President, are committed to these issues, as well. The President recently highlighted several initiatives designed to rebuild trust between </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> departments and the communities they serve. He received the final report from his landmark White House Task Force on 21st Century Policing. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He highlighted an open data project where technologists, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> associations, and community organizations will use data and technology to reduce use of force and increase transparency, and he highlighted the recently created body worn camera toolkit. And he announced the launch of the law enforcement equipment review of federal programs that support acquisitions of equipment by state, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In March, former Attorney General Holder announced the six pilot cities for the new National Initiative for Building Community Trust and Justice, an innovative $4.75 million program designed to enhance procedural justice, reduce bias and support reconciliation between communities and law enforcement. Attorney General Lynch is dedicated to continuing the department's commitment to these issues. She recently launched a national tour promoting community policing and announced $163 million in grant money available to advance the recommendations of the White House Task Force on 21st Century Policing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Importantly, we know that our reform work must go beyond the mechanics of good policing. We as a society must address the inequality and unfairness that pervade the larger criminal justice system. Often, an encounter with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is only the first contact in a process that involves prosecutors, defense attorneys, courts, correctional institutions and community supervision. Individuals experience these as facets of a unitary system, not as individual institutions. We cannot merely focus on reforming </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tactics without focusing on transforming broader criminal justice laws and priorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's why the Department of Justice has expanded its efforts in these other areas in recent years. Through the Smart on Crime Initiative, former Attorney General Holder instructed prosecutors to exercise their discretion to avoid charging low-level drug offenders with mandatory minimum sentences, resulting in the first drop in the federal prison population in 32 years, with no resulting increase in crime. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Along with the Access to Justice Initiative, the Civil Rights Division has advocated for increased resources for state public defense systems and for reform of local courts and jails that imprison individuals who are too poor to afford their fines. And we have brought a record number of suits to address conditions in America's jails and prisons, including the use of solitary confinement on juveniles and those with mental illness. Only by addressing the criminal justice system as a whole will be build the lasting trust between </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the communities that most need their services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So that's a small window into what we're doing in the policing and criminal justice areas. Ultimately, change requires commitment and work at the local level - through persistent and authentic engagement between law enforcement and the communities they serve. That is one of the reasons that we work so closely with U.S. Attorneys around the country and here in Chicago. The U.S. Attorneys provide essential expertise and knowledge to the Division as we address similar issues in sometimes very different communities. Zachary Fardon and his staff are crucial partners to the Civil Rights Division in this work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before I leave, let me be clear about something: We can accomplish the sweeping reform I have discussed. In Portland, Oregon, for example, two and a half years after we identified an institutional pattern of excessive force against people with mental illness, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are being retrained, accountability measures implemented and the incidence of using force has dropped dramatically. And in East Haven, Connecticut, residents are seeing transformative change in their </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> department just two years after the entry of a consent decree with the Justice Department. There is reason to be optimistic and believe that we can achieve reform that will keep individuals, communities and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> safe and ensure that communities have fair, impartial and constitutional policing. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is undoubtedly much work to be done, but law enforcement and communities alike feel the urgency right now. The commitment of the Civil Rights Division, U.S. Attorneys and the Justice Department is part of this work, as is commitment by attorneys and local bar associations. Criminal justice reform at legislatures and city councils is part of this work. And strong law enforcement leadership throughout the country is part of this work. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beyond the federal government and the legal community, there are concrete roles for people committed to improving </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-community relations, enabling racial reconciliation and promoting justice. It may seem trite but it is powerful when local communities and law enforcement engage directly and constructively with each other, when local leaders have relationships with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> chiefs, when we can understand each others' perspectives, each others' lives. This is hard, unsung work, but it's essential. And there's a role here for anyone who wants a safer, fairer, more equal society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no problem too intractable or impossible for people committed to justice. Justice requires hope and hard, persistent work. We cannot sit idly by and hope that the public attention these issues are receiving will diminish, because they won't, or at least not for long. And so I thank you for your work and for your commitment to justice. Thank you.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7"> BODY:<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Department of Justice has issued the following news release: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thank you, Steve [Edwards, Executive Director of the Institute of Politics], for inviting me here today.  It's an honor to speak with you about the work of the Civil Rights Division, particularly our work to ensure that policing is done in accordance with the Constitution and to help local </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> departments and the communities they serve build trust where it has eroded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eric Garner.  Tamir Rice.  John Crawford.  Walter Scott.  Freddie Gray.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These names and many others have become familiar to us under tragic circumstances in recent months. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deaths</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and those of other unarmed African-American men and women in encounters with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have provoked widespread responses across the country and have fueled the Black Lives Matter movement.  In communities of color, in particular, the reaction has been stark and sobering. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the seven months I have been at the Civil Rights Division, I have spent a lot of time with local leaders and community members in cities all across America, including with numerous mothers who have lost their children in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-involved shootings.  The pain, anger, frustration--the lack of trust in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">--is real, and it is profound.  Again and again, people have told me that young people are losing faith in our justice system and view law enforcement as preying on them rather than protecting their loved ones.  They talk about how the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> don't value their rights, or indeed, their lives.  They talk about being tired of being viewed as criminals first, human beings second.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conversation in these rooms, however, is not about whether to have </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or not, but about what kind of policing communities want and deserve. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no question that we need </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in our communities.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ensure the safety of our communities by patrolling neighborhoods, defending the rights of victims and deterring crime.  They are our first responders in many emergency situations.  And they can be role models for our young people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The overwhelming majority of the women and men who </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> our streets do their jobs with honor, pride and distinction.  Most of these individuals are driven to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> academy out of a commitment to public service and a desire to make an impact in their communities.  As we are reminded by the senseless and tragic assassinations of New York </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Department (NYPD) Detectives Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu in December, the shooting of two </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Ferguson in March, and the tragic injuries inflicted on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Baltimore a few weeks ago, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> do all of this at considerable risk to themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am struck everywhere I go by the wide gap in empathy and common language to discuss these problems.  Because in the very same cities and rooms where I speak with folks in the community, I hear from law enforcement who emphasize their responsibility to enforce the law and how they are doing the best job they can.  They feel attacked and undervalued.  They talk about how the actions of a few bad actors have tarnished the whole profession.  They talk about the fact that department budgets have been slashed over the last several years, resulting in drastic cuts for community policing and neighborhood patrols.  They point out that they are constantly making split second decisions and people don't account for the thousands of times situations don't escalate.  They talk about how the daily stress of their jobs takes a toll.  And they are right about all of this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite these divergent themes, there is one commonality in all rooms I am in.  And that is that everyone agrees that we are confronting grave challenges when it comes to the erosion of trust between </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the communities they serve throughout the United States.  The level of mistrust and resentment is unsettling.  Some, including NYPD Commissioner William Bratton, call it a &quot;crisis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The consequences of distrust between law enforcement and the communities they serve can be devastating.  Where people perceive the criminal justice system to be arbitrary, biased and unfair, they are less likely to cooperate with law enforcement, making us all less safe.  The distrust and alienation experienced in some communities can build into a powder keg of resentment, ready to be ignited by a single tragic incident.  We have seen this over and over--in Watts in 1965, in Los Angeles in 1992 and most recently, in Ferguson in 2014.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's worth asking, first, how did we get here?  And second, what are we going to do about it? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's start with the first question and consider the source of the mistrust.  Mistrust can't be explained away as the kneejerk reaction of the ill-informed or the hyperbolic.  It has many sources.  For some people, it's in part the product of historical awareness about the role that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> played, as Commissioner Bratton recently told a group of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in &quot;slavery, Reconstruction, Jim Crow, lynchings, blockbusting.&quot;  FBI Director James Comey has likewise noted, &quot;At many points in American history, law enforcement enforced the status quo, a status quo that was often brutally unfair to disfavored groups.&quot;  As Commissioner Bratton explained, this history has an enduring effect.  &quot;None of us did these things,&quot; he told his audience of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;None of us were troopers on the bridge at Selma.  But it doesn't matter that these things happened before many of us were even born.  What matters is that our history follows us like a second shadow.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mistrust is also the product of lived experience, of negative interactions that individuals - or their family members, friends or neighbors - have had with law enforcement.  Something as quietly humiliating as being mistreated during a traffic stop, or being followed in a retail store.  These stories can circulate through a neighborhood - or these days, across the nation via the web and social media - and they can build up over time into a painful narrative that divides community members and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lack of trust also undeniably results from our criminal justice policies over the last few decades, and the concentrated impact they have had on communities of color and people living in poverty.  Law enforcement practices such as the stopping and frisking of young black men based on stereotypes.  Sentencing policies that result in mass incarceration, particularly of people of color.  And the devastating consequences that convictions have had on individuals' ability to find work, secure stable housing and reintegrate as full members of society.  We bear the responsibility to confront these consequences and reevaluate our approach to criminal justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Civil Rights Division's investigation and March 2015 report on the Ferguson </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Department (FPD) speaks to much of what I have been talking about.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Ferguson, we found a community where unlawful </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> practices created an intensely charged atmosphere where people feel under siege by those charged to serve and protect them. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We determined that the FPD engages in a pattern or practice of conduct that violates the United States Constitution and federal law.  Specifically, we found that Ferguson PD routinely:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Conducts stops without reasonable suspicion and arrests without probable cause, in violation of the Fourth Amendment;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Uses excessive force in violation of the Fourth Amendment;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Unlawfully interferes with First Amendment rights, including the right to record and to protest </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> activity;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Impermissibly discriminates against African Americans in violation of the 14th Amendment and federal statutory law; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Violates due process and equal protection in the operation of its Municipal Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We found that this unconstitutional conduct stems from the interaction of two dynamics: Ferguson's undue focus on revenue generation through policing and pervasive racial bias in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> department and court system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These dynamics fostered unconstitutional practices at nearly every level of Ferguson's law enforcement system.  One example: During the summer of 2012, a Ferguson </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> detained a 32-year-old African-American man who had just finished playing basketball at a park.  The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> approached while the man was sitting in his car, cooling off. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The car's windows appeared to be more heavily tinted than Ferguson's code allowed, so the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> may have had grounds to question him.  But, with no apparent justification, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> proceeded to escalate the situation, accusing the man of being a pedophile.  He prohibited the man from using his cell phone and ordered him out of his car for a pat-down search, even though he had no reason to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">suspect</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that the man was </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And when the man objected - citing his constitutional rights - the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> drew his gun, pointed it at the man's head and arrested him on eight different counts.  The arrest caused the man to lose his job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We observed that even minor code violations can sometimes result in multiple arrests, jail time and payments that exceed the cost of the original ticket many times over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, in 2007, one woman received two parking tickets that - together - totaled $152.  To date, she has paid $550 in fines and fees to the city of Ferguson. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She's been arrested twice for having unpaid tickets and she has spent six days in jail.  Yet she still - inexplicably - owes Ferguson $541.  Her story is only one of dozens of similar accounts that our investigation uncovered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Ferguson, we also found evidence of unlawful discrimination.  African Americans make up 67 percent of the population, but from 2012 to 2014, they constituted:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    85 percent of the people subject to a vehicle stop;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    90 percent of people who received a citation; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    93 percent of people arrested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And discretionary </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> actions were overwhelmingly concentrated on the black population.  To take just one example, 95 percent of &quot;manner of walking in roadway&quot; charges - that's jaywalking - were levied against African Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We found racial disparities in virtually every available metric.  From 2012 to 2014, African Americans were more than twice as likely as white drivers to be searched during vehicle stops, but 26 percent less likely to be found in possession of contraband.  In 88 percent of cases in which FPD documented the use of force, force was used against African Americans.  In all cases in which canines were used against subjects for whom racial information is available, the subject was African-American.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The evidence of racial bias comes not only from statistics, but also from remarks made by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and court supervisors in disturbing email messages.  The emails were incontrovertible evidence of a culture infected by racial bias.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These findings reveal that the public trust in Ferguson law enforcement and its criminal justice system, especially among African Americans, was damaged long before August 2014.  When there is this level of broad community distrust, public safety suffers and the job of delivering </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> services is rendered more difficult and more dangerous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In many ways, Ferguson is not an anomaly.  We know from our work around the country that some of the same </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and court practices that we identified in Ferguson - and the same deficit of trust between </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and communities - exist in many other places.  Local officials recognize this, as well.  I know of several </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> chiefs around the country who have assigned the report as required reading for their </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And in light of the report, cities around the country are beginning to re-examine their policing and municipal court practices.  Undoubtedly, there is much more work to do, but there's also much to be hopeful about.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In many communities, thoughtful </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and city leaders are working to re-prioritize community policing and rebuild community trust.  Take Cleveland.  Mayor Frank Jackson asked the Civil Rights Division to investigate the Cleveland Division of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (CDP) in March 2013. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In December 2014, we announced the results of our investigation, concluding that Cleveland </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> engage in a pattern or practice of unreasonable and unnecessary force, including deadly force such as shootings and head strikes with impact weapons.  We also found that the pattern of excessive force had eroded public confidence in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thanks to the commitment of Mayor Jackson, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chief Calvin Williams, the city's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> unions and community members, we entered into a negotiated reform agreement a mere five months after issuing our initial report.  The agreement takes the form of a consent decree that will be independently monitored and enforceable in court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a truly innovative and comprehensive agreement.  It addresses </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> needs by requiring CDP to develop an Equipment and Resource Plan to ensure that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have the equipment they need - such as computers and safe vehicles - to do their jobs safely.  It calls for additional training and an effective employee assistance program to give </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ready access to mental health and support resources. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It sets up a new Community </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Commission - made up of 10 civilian representatives from across the city and one member from each of the city's three </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> unions - that will work with the Division of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to improve community policing, bias-free policing and transparency.  Through this body, the Cleveland community will play a central role in the development of many important </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">polices,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> including those related to use of force and search and seizure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agreement also calls for:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    A civilian head of Internal Affairs, to ensure that internal investigations of misconduct are impartial and reliable;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Specialized training in interacting with persons in mental health crisis, and a Mental Health Response Advisory Committee to foster relationships between the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the community and mental health providers;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Revised use-of-force policies and training that will require </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to use de-escalation techniques, rather than force, wherever possible;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Strengthened reporting and supervision requirements, along with broad data collection; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Many other provisions aimed at promoting public safety and building trust between the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Cleveland agreement reflects a commitment by the City and the Division of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to work with the Cleveland community to transform this </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> agency into a model of community-oriented policing.  The agreement also demonstrates that people can come together across perceived differences to realize a common vision of a safer, more just city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Baltimore is another city in which local officials are stepping up to tackle longstanding divisions and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-community divisions.  Last month, Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake asked us to investigate the Baltimore </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Department for a pattern or practice of civil rights violations. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That same day, the City's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> commissioner and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> union released statements agreeing with the Mayor's request and welcoming our involvement.  Gene Ryan, President of the Baltimore City Fraternal Order of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lodge No. 3, released a statement stating that the union intends to &quot;fully cooperate with any investigation that has the potential to correct departmental deficiencies and improve the morale of our members . . . As the labor union that represents the nearly 3,000 active duty members of the agency, we agree with (the) Mayor on her invitation to the Department of Justice and welcome their investigation fully as we, too, have issues with many of the current policies and procedures of the department.&quot;  After considering the relevant factors, we accepted the City's invitation and opened an investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wherever this investigation may lead - we don't know what we'll find, and we will never prejudge any outcome - our goal is to work with the community, public officials, law enforcement </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> unions to help build a stronger, better Baltimore. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As events in both Cleveland and Baltimore show, the commitment of all of these local actors is essential if we are to move forward.  To restore trust where it has been badly eroded.  To promote healing - and address problems that are common to so many great cities across America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I said there were two questions - what the sources of mistrust are and what we are going to do about it.  The second question is hard, but we have an unprecedented opportunity now to address fundamental problems in the way communities across the country interact with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and with the criminal justice system more generally. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the Civil Rights Division and others in this room and beyond have been working on policing issues for many years, the nation is paying attention because communities are demanding it.  The reality is we tend to confront systemic problems only when forced to by seemingly extraordinary events. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Journalists now are doing impressive investigative reporting on excessive force, racial profiling and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-community relations.  Universities are doing important research and analysis of these problems.  And families are talking about them at the dinner table.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Importantly, the focus on policing issues is happening in a broader conversation about the need to reform our criminal justice system.  There is no question, and I speak from personal experience, that 15 years ago, criminal justice reform was a lonely endeavor.  Few on the Left or the Right were willing to champion its cause.  Today, there is a widespread, even bipartisan, recognition that our criminal justice system needs an overhaul that it should not be the go-to answer for social problems and that mass incarceration has damaged this country in countless ways.  Law enforcement leaders themselves talk about how they have become first responders for a whole host of social problems, including homelessness, mental illness, drug dependency and school discipline. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is now growing consensus that in too many places, the only response we have made available to these challenges is arrest and incarceration as opposed to evidence-based, alternative interventions.  There is real reform taking place on these broader criminal justice issues right now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For these reasons, we should be optimistic about this moment.  The public is engaged and there is an opportunity for real progress. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is the work ahead?  At the Civil Rights Division, we have redoubled our efforts to ensure that policing is done in accordance with the Constitution and to help local </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> departments and the communities they serve build trust where it has eroded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We can and do prosecute individual </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for intentional misconduct.  In fact, we have prosecuted nearly 400 law enforcement </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> over just the last six years for constitutional violations.   This includes our joint prosecution with the Chicago U.S. Attorney's Office of former Chicago </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Department Commander Jon Burge in 2010 on perjury and obstruction charges, relating to the torture and abuse of detainees in the 1980s.                         </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Criminal prosecution, however, is only one tool, and a limited one at that.  We also engage in systemic reform of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> departments, like in Ferguson and Cleveland.  Since the start of the administration, the Division has opened 22 investigations into </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> departments.  We have also entered into 17 agreements with law enforcement agencies, including consent decrees in New Orleans; Puerto Rico; Seattle; Portland, Oregon; Detroit; the Virgin Islands; East Haven,  Connecticut; Warren, Ohio; Albuquerque, New Mexico; and Los Angeles.  The department currently has eight open investigations.  In the majority of these investigations the Division has issued findings or technical assistance letters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As discussed above, the Division is often invited into communities with the support of elected officials, law enforcement, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> unions and communities.  Working together with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and community members, we are helping to change the way </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> services are delivered, to reduce the use of unnecessary force and to combat the influence of racial and ethnic bias in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> decision making.  We call the last five years of our work in this area &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reform 2.0&quot; because we learned a lot from the first 15 years of enforcement and we have incorporated lessons learned from that first decade and a half into our more recent efforts.  &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reform 2.0&quot; entails exhaustive engagement with the community through individual interviews and town hall meetings.  We meet with local officials and civil rights leaders.  We learn from law enforcement leaders.  And we spend a lot of time speaking with line </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers and with police unions</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.  Too often, they tell us that they lack adequate support, training, policy guidance, supervision and even equipment to keep them safe and allow them to engage in constitutional policing that keeps them and the public safe. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even after we announce our findings, we continue intensive engagement with all of the various stakeholders, including community leaders, line </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers and police unions</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to help shape the remedies that we negotiate at arm's length with city officials.  In Ferguson, we have met with several community groups and held an open community forum to learn how area residents wanted to see their </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> department and court system change.  Several weeks ago, our attorneys facilitated small group discussions, standing at oversized notepads with marker in hand, taking down the groups' ideas.  In our view, this is how reform starts.  The stakeholders must feel investment in the remedies laid out in our agreements for them to be successful and sustainable. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Through this inclusive approach to reform, we have identified certain elements that are absolutely required to build trust and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> legitimacy where they have eroded.  For example, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> commanders must create opportunities for line </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to have positive interactions, outside of the enforcement context, with individuals they may encounter as victims, witnesses or subjects. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a fundamental component of community policing.  Departments must also commit to transparency, because the more communities know about </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> activity, the more operations can reflect community values and priorities.  Structured community engagement is vital - there are a host of models for that and I know you will be having a panel about civilian oversight.  We need better research and data.  There is a lot we don't know that we should, so thoughtful data collection and analysis is a priority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There must be fair, consistent and robust internal and external systems of accountability so that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> departments can course correct when problems are identified.  Improper bias - both explicit and implicit bias - must be identified and corrected.  Critically, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> must be given the specialized training to do their jobs consistent with community values and the professional support to cope with stress and trauma they encounter on the job.  They need training to ensure de-escalation with the mentally ill and others in crisis, as well as to ensure respectful interactions with LGBTI, immigrants with language barriers and other vulnerable populations. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And procedural justice matters.  Research shows that being treated fairly and respectfully matters more than the ultimate result of a person's interaction with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We build these concepts into all of our consent decrees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the past three years, the Division has successfully concluded the implementation of three consent decrees, as well as a memorandum of agreement.  Most recently, on May 11, 2015, the Division and the U.S. Attorney's Office announced that the Missoula, Montana, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Department had fully implemented the requirements of its agreement with the department to improve its response to reports of sexual assault.  The Missoula </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Department's successful implementation of the agreement in just two years illustrates the power of government, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and community leaders working together to create change that makes law enforcement and communities safer and stronger. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Civil Rights Division is trying to address problems in policing from every angle.  For example, our Educational Opportunities Section is working to disrupt the school-to-prison pipeline by intervening where school discipline practices are overly punitive and disproportionately enforced against students of color.  Our Employment Litigation Section has brought suits around the country to end discrimination in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hiring.  And our Federal Coordination and Compliance Section is working to ensure that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and court services are available to those with limited English proficiency. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The department, and indeed the President, are committed to these issues, as well. The President recently highlighted several initiatives designed to rebuild trust between </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> departments and the communities they serve.  He received the final report from his landmark White House Task Force on 21st Century Policing.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He highlighted an open data project where technologists, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> associations, and community organizations will use data and technology to reduce use of force and increase transparency, and he highlighted the recently created body worn camera toolkit.  And he announced the launch of the law enforcement equipment review of federal programs that support acquisitions of equipment by state, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In March, former Attorney General Holder announced the six pilot cities for the new National Initiative for Building Community Trust and Justice, an innovative $4.75 million program designed to enhance procedural justice, reduce bias and support reconciliation between communities and law enforcement.  Attorney General Lynch is dedicated to continuing the department's commitment to these issues.  She recently launched a national tour promoting community policing and announced $163 million in grant money available to advance the recommendations of the White House Task Force on 21st Century Policing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Importantly, we know that our reform work must go beyond the mechanics of good policing.  We as a society must address the inequality and unfairness that pervade the larger criminal justice system.  Often, an encounter with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is only the first contact in a process that involves prosecutors, defense attorneys, courts, correctional institutions and community supervision.  Individuals experience these as facets of a unitary system, not as individual institutions.  We cannot merely focus on reforming </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tactics without focusing on transforming broader criminal justice laws and priorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's why the Department of Justice has expanded its efforts in these other areas in recent years.  Through the Smart on Crime Initiative, former Attorney General Holder instructed prosecutors to exercise their discretion to avoid charging low-level drug offenders with mandatory minimum sentences, resulting in the first drop in the federal prison population in 32 years, with no resulting increase in crime. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Along with the Access to Justice Initiative, the Civil Rights Division has advocated for increased resources for state public defense systems and for reform of local courts and jails that imprison individuals who are too poor to afford their fines.  And we have brought a record number of suits to address conditions in America's jails and prisons, including the use of solitary confinement on juveniles and those with mental illness.  Only by addressing the criminal justice system as a whole will be build the lasting trust between </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the communities that most need their services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So that's a small window into what we're doing in the policing and criminal justice areas.  Ultimately, change requires commitment and work at the local level - through persistent and authentic engagement between law enforcement and the communities they serve.  That is one of the reasons that we work so closely with U.S. Attorneys around the country and here in Chicago.  The U.S. Attorneys provide essential expertise and knowledge to the Division as we address similar issues in sometimes very different communities. Zachary Fardon and his staff are crucial partners to the Civil Rights Division in this work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before I leave, let me be clear about something:  We can accomplish the sweeping reform I have discussed.  In Portland, Oregon, for example, two and a half years after we identified an institutional pattern of excessive force against people with mental illness, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are being retrained, accountability measures implemented and the incidence of using force has dropped dramatically.  And in East Haven, Connecticut, residents are seeing transformative change in their </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> department just two years after the entry of a consent decree with the Justice Department.  There is reason to be optimistic and believe that we can achieve reform that will keep individuals, communities and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> safe and ensure that communities have fair, impartial and constitutional policing.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is undoubtedly much work to be done, but law enforcement and communities alike feel the urgency right now.   The commitment of the Civil Rights Division, U.S. Attorneys and the Justice Department is part of this work, as is commitment by attorneys and local bar associations.  Criminal justice reform at legislatures and city councils is part of this work.  And strong law enforcement leadership throughout the country is part of this work. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beyond the federal government and the legal community, there are concrete roles for people committed to improving </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-community relations, enabling racial reconciliation and promoting justice.  It may seem trite but it is powerful when local communities and law enforcement engage directly and constructively with each other, when local leaders have relationships with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> chiefs, when we can understand each others' perspectives, each others' lives.  This is hard, unsung work, but it's essential.  And there's a role here for anyone who wants a safer, fairer, more equal society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no problem too intractable or impossible for people committed to justice.  Justice requires hope and hard, persistent work.  We cannot sit idly by and hope that the public attention these issues are receiving will diminish, because they won't, or at least not for long.  And so I thank you for your work and for your commitment to justice.  Thank you.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A car backfires in the streets of Cleveland, Ohio. Nearby </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> think it's gunfire. Thus begins the November 2012 chase. Sixty </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cruisers race at 160 kilometres per hour for more than 20 minutes until they corner the car. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> fire 137 rounds.

Both are killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one knows for sure how many civilians are killed every year by US </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or die in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> custody. The website Killed by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has logged 474 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deaths</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> so far this year, an average of three per day so far in 2015.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Washington Post last month examined 385 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deaths</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> gunshot and found 80 per cent of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">victims had been armed</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with lethal weapons. Half were white, half black. Sixteen per cent &acirc;[#x20ac]&quot; or 62 of the dead &acirc;[#x20ac]&quot; were unarmed people, two-thirds of them black or Hispanics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blacks make up only 13 per cent of the US population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly a year since the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> killings of two unarmed black males &acirc;[#x20ac]&quot; Eric Garner in New York City in July, and teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri in August &acirc;[#x20ac]&quot; questions about excessive use of force by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and racial bias have provoked not only angry riots over Brown's and other killings but also soul-searching in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sometimes it seems like our young </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> want to get into an athletic event with people they want to arrest,&quot; said Dallas, Texas, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> chief David Brown, an African-American, at a recent symposium of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> chiefs organised by the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Executive Research Forum (PERF).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Don't retreat' mentality</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They have a 'don't retreat' mentality. They feel like they're warriors, and they can't back down when someone is running from them, no matter how minor the underlying crime is,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over decades, the US Supreme Court has reduced </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> authority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> must now inform suspects of their right to an attorney before questioning, and may not use deadly force in a chase unless the suspect threatens &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or serious physical injury to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or others&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These days, bystanders with cell phone cameras, the post-9/11expansion of security cameras and social media have created a new round of scrutiny on how </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> behave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year in Canada, which also grapples with the issue, 22 cameras filmed the actions of a Toronto </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as he used three shots to down a mentally disturbed, knife-wielding Syrian man &acirc;[#x20ac]&quot; then fired another six shots into the prone body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> advocates worry that the high profile films, protests and riots after the killing of Brown, Freddie Gray in Baltimore, Garner and others have demonised </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and threatened their lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> being targeted</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least 54 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have died in the course of duty this year so far, and at least five are believed to have been targeted killings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eugene O'Donnell, an ex-New York </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice at the City University of New York, condemned the &quot;great smearing&quot; of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in his tribute to a New York </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> recently felled by assault.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cops today find themselves challenged during routine calls, cameras thrust in their faces, accused of discriminatory treatment by many,&quot; he wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But others in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> community are equally worried about the killings of suspects, and are calling for changes in the way </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are prepared for duty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yes, they might be shooting too many people, but that's a training issue more than a race issue ... We blame cops for things that aren't their fault &acirc;[#x20ac]&quot; society's racism, or how they are trained,&quot; says Peter Moskos, a former Baltimore </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who teaches at the local John Jay College of Criminal Justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, three of the six Baltimore </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> charged in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of Freddie Gray in April are black, challenging the notion that excessive force is just a white-on-black issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experts say training needs to include preparation for how to disengage, de-escalate and step back, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> chiefs and advocates say. Training needs to give permission to back off when circumstances allow, said Cassandra Deck-Brown, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> chief in Raleigh, North Carolina and an African-American, at the PERF symposium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The concept of community policing has pushed more </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> back to walking the beat, getting to know the people they are charged with protecting. For Moskos and others, the push has largely succeeded and cops are using less force now than they did 20 and 30 years ago, even if it seems otherwise in social media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nonetheless, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &acirc;[#x20ac]&quot; whether black or white &acirc;[#x20ac]&quot; tend to be conservative, and the people who are doing the firearms training &quot;are often the most militaristic and conservative&quot; of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> trainers, Moskos said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's the mentality side of those conservative trainers that then gets passed down to cops, and that's not necessarily good,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The public is rightfully upset.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> advocates worry that the high profile films, protests and riots after the killing of Brown, Freddie Gray in Baltimore, Garner and others have demonised </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and threatened their lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> being targeted</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least 54 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have died in the course of duty this year so far, and at least five are believed to have been targeted killings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eugene O'Donnell, an ex-New York </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice at the City University of New York, condemned the &quot;great smearing&quot; of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in his tribute to a New York </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> recently felled by assault.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cops today find themselves challenged during routine calls, cameras thrust in their faces, accused of discriminatory treatment by many,&quot; he wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But others in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> community are equally worried about the killings of suspects, and are calling for changes in the way </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are prepared for duty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yes, they might be shooting too many people, but that's a training issue more than a race issue ... We blame cops for things that aren't their fault &acirc;[#x20ac]&quot; society's racism, or how they are trained,&quot; says Peter Moskos, a former Baltimore </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who teaches at the local John Jay College of Criminal Justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, three of the six Baltimore </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> charged in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of Freddie Gray in April are black, challenging the notion that excessive force is just a white-on-black issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experts say training needs to include preparation for how to disengage, de-escalate and step back, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> chiefs and advocates say. Training needs to give permission to back off when circumstances allow, said Cassandra Deck-Brown, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> chief in Raleigh, North Carolina and an African-American, at the PERF symposium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The concept of community policing has pushed more </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> back to walking the beat, getting to know the people they are charged with protecting. For Moskos and others, the push has largely succeeded and cops are using less force now than they did 20 and 30 years ago, even if it seems otherwise in social media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nonetheless, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &acirc;[#x20ac]&quot; whether black or white &acirc;[#x20ac]&quot; tend to be conservative, and the people who are doing the firearms training &quot;are often the most militaristic and conservative&quot; of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> trainers, Moskos said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's the mentality side of those conservative trainers that then gets passed down to cops, and that's not necessarily good,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The public is rightfully upset.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SAN JOSE -- A San Jose </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has been cleared in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">fatal</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shooting of a bipolar 19-year-old woman during an August encounter in which she walked outside with a cordless power drill painted black, which </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> thought might be a machine gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors announced Thursday that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wakana Okuma, a 13-year veteran, acted lawfully when she fired a single shot from her AR-15 rifle at Diana Showman the morning of Aug. 14 in front of her father's South San Jose home, on Blossom Hill Road near Playa del Rey.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Okuma believed the drill was a firearm and thought she was going to be killed by Showman,&quot; the Santa Clara County District Attorney's Office states in its </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-involved shooting report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Showman's parents have repeatedly challenged that contention, saying their daughter might not have taken her medication for bipolar disorder that morning and was not a threat. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have said that the emergency call in which she claimed to be armed and made threats against her family forced their response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The family filed a claim against the city of San Jose in February to preserve their right to file a lawsuit and seek damages, and are pushing for changes in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> training and use of force. Her family believed that after two decades with an affliction that demanded constant attention and an array of medications, independence had become a real possibility for the Leigh High School graduate, an avid softball player and mentor for special-needs children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The DA's report doesn't change anything for us,&quot; said Victoria Showman, Diana's mother. &quot;We're committed for Diana's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to have meaning. This isn't going to stop us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Okuma, one of the first </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to respond to the scene, was certified in Crisis Intervention Team training and specialized in handling calls involving the mentally ill. But the report states that &quot;because of how quickly the events unfolded, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Okuma did not think that her Crisis Intervention Training came into play.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steven Clark, an attorney representing the Showman family, challenged that stance. He noted the report's finding that Diana Showman was on the phone with a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> dispatcher for at least 20 minutes before she emerged from the home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We take strong umbrage with the contention there was not enough time to defuse,&quot; Clark said. &quot;This is (the) exact situation where that training can be used.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If anything, the shooting makes the case for increased and ongoing training, said Jim Showman, Diana's father.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's got to be a different outcome,&quot; he said. &quot;There is no way Diana's actions justified her life being taken.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the morning of the shooting, Diana Showman called 911 and reportedly told emergency dispatchers she had an Uzi and was going to shoot her mother and brother, who she said were locked in a bedroom. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> later learned no one else was home at the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and witnesses, Showman exited her home just before 11 a.m. with an item in each hand. She soon dropped one of the items, later identified as the cellphone she used to call 911. But she kept the second item, later revealed to be a cordless drill painted black, in her right hand and walked slowly toward the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> defying their orders to drop it, instead alternating between raising and lowering it. As she got near Okuma -- estimates range from 10 feet to as far as 30 feet -- the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> fired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Given the appearance of the painted drill and the dispatcher's report that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">suspect</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> claimed to be </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with an Uzi, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Okuma believed and was reasonable in believing that the drill was some type of firearm,&quot; the report stated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report states that the drill, which did not have a bit inside, was originally yellow, and investigators suspect Showman spray-painted it black the morning of the shooting. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> found a can of spray paint matching the color of the drill inside the garage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Victoria Showman wants to see independent panels review </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-involved shootings, and she said she hopes that the national conversation over use of force continues. Clark added that as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are increasingly relied on to respond to mental health crises -- owing in part to a dearth of public resources available -- </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> must revamp their approach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Too many </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-involved shootings involve people with mental health challenges. The Showmans want to give a voice to those people. They're speaking for others,&quot; Clark said. &quot;They want to see those numbers change.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thank you to Constance Talmage, John Walsh and the Colorado Lawyers Committee for inviting me here today. It's an honor to speak with you today about the work of the Civil Rights Division, particularly our work to ensure that policing is done in accordance with the Constitution and to help local </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> departments and the communities they serve build trust where it has eroded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eric Garner. Michael Brown. Tamir Rice. John Crawford. Walter Scott. Freddie Gray.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These names and many others have become familiar to us under tragic circumstances in recent months. Their </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deaths</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and those of other unarmed African American men and women in encounters with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, have provoked widespread responses across the country and have fueled the Black Lives Matter movement. In communities of color, in particular, the reaction has been stark and sobering. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the seven months I have been at the Civil Rights Division, I have spent a lot of time with local leaders and community members in cities all across America, including with numerous mothers who have lost their children in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-involved shootings. The pain, anger, frustration--the lack of trust in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">--is real, and it is profound. Again and again, people have told me that young people are losing faith in our justice system and view law enforcement as preying on them rather than protecting their loved ones. They talk about how the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> don't value their rights, or indeed, their lives. They talk about being tired of being viewed as criminals first, human beings second.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conversation in these rooms, however, is not about whether to have </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or not but about what kind of policing communities want and deserve. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no question that we need </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in our communities. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ensure the safety of our communities by patrolling neighborhoods, defending the rights of victims and deterring crime. They are our first responders in many emergency situations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The overwhelming majority of the women and men who </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> our streets do their jobs with honor, pride and distinction. Most of these individuals are driven to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> academy out of a commitment to public service and a desire to make an impact in their communities. As the senseless and tragic assassinations of NYPD </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu this spring, the shooting of two </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Ferguson in March and the tragic injuries inflicted on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Baltimore a few weeks ago, remind us, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> do all of this at considerable risk to themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am struck everywhere I go by the wide gap in empathy and common language to discuss these problems. Because in the very same cities and rooms where I speak with folks in the community, I hear from law enforcement who emphasize their responsibility to enforce the law and how they are doing the best job they can. They feel attacked and undervalued. They talk about how the actions of a few bad actors have tarnished the whole profession. They talk about the fact that department budgets have been slashed over the last several years, resulting in drastic cuts for community policing and neighborhood patrols. They talk about how they are constantly making split second decisions and people don't account for the thousands of times situations don't escalate and how the daily stress of their jobs take a toll.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there is one certain commonality in all rooms I am in. And that is that everyone agrees that we are confronting grave challenges when it comes to the erosion of trust between </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the communities they serve throughout the United States. The level of mistrust and resentment is unsettling. Some, including NYPD Commissioner William Bratton, call it a &quot;crisis in American policing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The consequences of distrust between law enforcement and the communities they serve can be devastating. Where people perceive the criminal justice system to be arbitrary, biased and unfair, they are less likely to cooperate with law enforcement, making us all less safe. The distrust and alienation experienced in some communities can build into a powder keg of resentment, ready to be ignited by a single tragic incident. We have seen this over and over--in Watts in 1965, in Los Angeles in 1992 and most recently, in Ferguson in 2014.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's worth asking, first, how did we get here? And second, what are we going to do about it? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's start with the first question and consider the source of the mistrust. Mistrust can't be explained away as the kneejerk reaction of the ill-informed or the hyperbolic. It's in part the product of historical awareness about the role that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have played in enforcing and perpetuating slavery, the Black Codes, lynchings and Jim Crow segregation. As FBI Director James Comey noted, &quot;At many points in American history, law enforcement enforced the status quo, a status quo that was often brutally unfair to disfavored groups.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is also the product of lived experience, of negative interactions that individuals -- or their family members, friends, or neighbors -- have had with law enforcement. Something as quietly humiliating as being mistreated during a traffic stop, or being followed in a retail store. These stories can circulate through a neighborhood -- or these days, across the nation via the web and social media -- and they can build up over time into a painful narrative that divides community members and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lack of trust also undeniably results from our criminal justice policies over the last few decades, and the concentrated impact they have had on communities of color and people living in poverty. Law enforcement practices such as the stopping and frisking of young black men based on stereotypes. Sentencing policies that result in mass incarceration, particularly of people of color. And the devastating consequences that convictions have had on individuals' ability to find work, secure stable housing and reintegrate as full members of society. These are deliberate policy choices that we made over the last several decades. We bear the responsibility to confront their consequences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Civil Rights Division's investigation and recently released report on the Ferguson </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Department speaks to all of what I have been talking about.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Ferguson, we found a community where unlawful </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> practices have not only severely undermined the public trust and made local residents less safe - but created an intensely charged atmosphere where people feel under siege by those charged to serve and protect them. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We determined that the FPD engages in a pattern or practice of conduct that violates the United States Constitution and federal law. Specifically, we found that Ferguson PD routinely:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Conducts stops without reasonable suspicion and arrests without probable cause, in violation of the Fourth Amendment;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Uses unreasonable force in violation of the Fourth Amendment;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unlawfully interferes with First Amendment rights, including the right to record and to protest </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> activity;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Impermissibly discriminates against African Americans in violation of the 14th Amendment and federal statutory law; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Violates due process and equal protection in the operation of its Municipal Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We found that this unconstitutional conduct stems from the interaction of two dynamics: Ferguson's undue focus on revenue generation through policing and pervasive racial bias in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> department and court system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These dynamics fostered unconstitutional practices at nearly every level of Ferguson's law enforcement system. One example: During the summer of 2012, a Ferguson </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> detained a 32-year-old African American man who had just finished playing basketball at a park. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> approached while the man was sitting in his car, cooling off. The car's windows appeared to be more heavily tinted than Ferguson's code allowed, so the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> may have had grounds to question him. But, with no apparent justification, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> proceeded to escalate the situation, accusing the man of being a pedophile. He prohibited the man from using his cell phone and ordered him out of his car for a pat-down search, even though he had no reason to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">suspect</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that the man was </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And when the man objected - citing his constitutional rights - the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> drew his gun, pointed it at the man's head and arrested him on eight different counts. The arrest caused the man to lose his job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We observed that even minor code violations can sometimes result in multiple arrests, jail time and payments that exceed the cost of the original ticket many times over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, in 2007, one woman received two parking tickets that - together - totaled $152. To date, she has paid $550 in fines and fees to the city of Ferguson. She's been arrested twice for having unpaid tickets and she has spent six days in jail. Yet she still - inexplicably - owes Ferguson $541. Her story is only one of dozens of similar accounts that our investigation uncovered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By exposing the harm that the Ferguson court system causes, our findings report contributes to a growing understanding of a significant problem in our criminal justice system: the economic exploitation of the poor. The use of modern-day debtors' prisons, the outsourcing of supervision to private probation companies, the imposition of fees on defendants to avail themselves of court-appointed attorneys and the right to a jury trial--these are dangerous trends that should concern us all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Ferguson, we also found evidence of unlawful discrimination. African Americans make up 67% of the population, but from 2012 to 2014, they constituted:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 85% of the people subject to a vehicle stop;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 90% of people who received a citation; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 93% of people arrested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And discretionary </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> actions were overwhelmingly concentrated on the black population. To take just one example, 95% of &quot;manner of walking in roadway&quot; charges--that's jaywalking--were levied against African Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We found racial disparities in virtually every available metric. From 2012 to 2014, African Americans were more than twice as likely as white drivers to be searched during vehicle stops, but 26% less likely to be found in possession of contraband. In 88% of cases in which FPD documented the use of force, force was used against African Americans. In all cases in which canines were used against subjects for whom racial information is available, the subject was African American.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The evidence of racial bias comes not only from statistics, but also from remarks made by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> city and court officials. Some of you may be aware of the emails we discovered during our investigation. The emails were incontrovertible evidence of a culture that tolerated and perhaps even celebrated racial bias.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These findings reveal that the public trust in Ferguson law enforcement and its criminal justice system, especially among African Americans, was damaged long before August 2014. When there is this level of broad community distrust, public safety suffers and the job of delivering </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> services is rendered more difficult and more dangerous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although we do not know what we will uncover in future investigations - and will never prejudge any outcome - in the weeks ahead, we pledge to bring the same rigor, the same fairness and the same impartiality to Baltimore, where the Division has launched a civil investigation into the Baltimore </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wherever this investigation may lead, our goal is to work with the community, public officials and law enforcement to help build a stronger, better Baltimore. To restore trust where it has been badly eroded. To promote healing - and address problems that are common to so many great cities across America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In many ways, Ferguson is not an anomaly. Through our work around the country, we know there are similar </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and court practices in many places. I also know of several </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> chiefs around the country that assigned the report as required reading for their </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We are already seeing the force multiplying effect of the report. In the days subsequent to the issuance of our report, cities around the country are beginning to re-examine their policing and municipal court practices, though we know there is much more work to do. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I said there were two questions--what the sources of mistrust are and what we are going to do about it. The second question is hard but we have an unprecedented opportunity now to address fundamental problems in the way communities across the country interact with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and with the criminal justice system more generally. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the Civil Rights Division and others in this room and beyond have been working on policing issues for many years, the nation is paying attention because communities are demanding it. The reality is we tend to confront systemic problems only when forced to by seemingly extraordinary events. Journalists now are doing impressive investigative reporting on excessive force, racial profiling and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-community relations. Universities are doing important research and analysis of these problems. And families are talking about them at the dinner table.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Importantly, the focus on policing issues is happening in a broader conversation about the need to reform our criminal justice system. There is no question, and I speak from personal experience, that 15 years ago, criminal justice reform was a lonely endeavor. Few on the Left or the Right were willing to champion its cause. Today, there is a widespread, even bipartisan, recognition that our criminal justice system needs an overhaul, that it should not be the go to answer for social problems and that mass incarceration has damaged this country in countless ways. Law enforcement leaders themselves talk about how they have become first responders for a whole host of social problems, including homelessness, mental illness, drug dependency, school discipline. And in too many places, the only response we have made available to them is arrest and incarceration as opposed to evidence-based, alternative interventions. There is real reform taking place on broader criminal justice issues right now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For these reasons, we should be optimistic about this moment. The public is engaged and there is an opportunity for real progress. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is the work ahead? At the Civil Rights Division, we have redoubled our efforts to ensure that policing is done in accordance with the Constitution and to help local </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> departments and the communities they serve build trust where it has eroded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We can and do prosecute individual </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for intentional misconduct. In fact, we have prosecuted nearly 400 law enforcement </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> over just the last six years for constitutional violations. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Criminal prosecution, however, is only one tool, and a limited one at that. We also engage in systemic reform of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> departments, like in Ferguson. Since the start of the administration, the Division has opened 22 investigations into </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> departments, including most recently the Baltimore City </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Department. We also are currently enforcing 16 agreements with law enforcement agencies, including consent decrees in New Orleans, Puerto Rico, Seattle, Portland (Oregon), Detroit, the Virgin Islands, East Haven (Connecticut), Warren (Ohio), Albuquerque and Los Angeles. The department currently has nine open investigations. In the majority of these investigations the Division has issued findings or technical assistance letters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The division is often invited into communities with the support of elected officials, law enforcement, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> unions and communities. For example, two weeks ago, Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake invited the division to conduct a review of the Baltimore </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Department. In response to the Mayor's request, Gene Ryan, president of the Baltimore City Fraternal Order of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lodge No. 3, released a statement, saying the union intends to &quot;fully cooperate with any investigation that has the potential to correct departmental deficiencies and improve the morale of our members . . . As the labor union that represents the nearly 3,000 active duty members of the agency, we agree with (the) mayor on her invitation to the Department of Justice and welcome their investigation fully as we, too, have issues with many of the current policies and procedures of the department.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Working together with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and community members, we are helping to change the way </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> services are delivered, to reduce the use of unnecessary force and to combat the influence of racial and ethnic bias in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> decision making. We call the last five years of our work in this area &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reform 2.0&quot; because we learned a lot from the first 15 years of enforcement and we have incorporated lessons learned from that first decade and a half into our more recent efforts. &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reform 2.0&quot; entails exhaustive engagement with the community through individual interviews and town hall meetings. We meet with local officials and civil rights leaders. We learn from law enforcement leaders. And we spend a lot of time speaking with line </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers and with police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> unions. Too often, they tell us that they lack adequate support, training, policy guidance, supervision and even equipment to keep them safe and allow them to engage in constitutional policing that keeps them and the public safe. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even after we announce our findings, we continue intensive engagement with all of the various stakeholders, including community leaders, line </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers and police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> unions to help shape the remedies that we negotiate at arm's length with city officials. In Ferguson, we have met with several community groups and held an open community forum to learn how area residents wanted to see their </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> department and court system change. Several weeks ago, our attorneys facilitated small group discussions, standing with an oversized notepad with marker in hand, taking down the groups' ideas. In our view, this is how reform starts. The stakeholders must feel investment in the remedies laid out in our agreements for them to be successful and sustainable. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Through this inclusive approach to reform, we have identified certain elements that are absolutely required to build trust and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> legitimacy where they have eroded. For example, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> commanders must create opportunities for line </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to have positive interactions, outside of the enforcement context, with individuals they may encounter as victims, witnesses, or subjects. This is a fundamental component of community policing. Departments must also commit to transparency, because the more communities know about </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> activity, the more operations can reflect community values and priorities. Structured community engagement is vital - there are a host of models for that and I know you will be having a panel about civilian oversight. We need better research and data. There is a lot we don't know that we should, so thoughtful data collection and analysis is a priority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There must be fair, consistent and robust internal and external systems of accountability so that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> departments can course correct when problems are identified. Improper bias -- both explicit and implicit bias -- must be identified and corrected. Critically, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> must be given the specialized training to do their jobs consistent with community values and the professional support to cope with stress and trauma they encounter on the job. They need training to ensure de-escalation with the mentally ill and others in crisis, as well as to ensure respectful interactions with LGBTI, immigrants with language barriers and other vulnerable populations. And procedural justice matters. Research shows that being treated fairly and respectfully matters more than the ultimate result of a person's interaction with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We build these concepts into all of our consent decrees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the past three years, the division has successfully concluded the implementation of three consent decrees, as well as a memorandum of agreement. Most recently, on May 11, 2015, the division and the U.S. Attorney's Office announced that the Missoula, Montana, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Department had fully implemented the requirements of its agreement with the department to improve the its response to reports of sexual assault. The Missoula </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Department's successful implementation of the agreement in just two years illustrates the power of government, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and community leaders working together to create change that makes law enforcement and communities safer and stronger. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Civil Rights Division is also trying to address problems in policing from every angle. For example, our Educational Opportunities Section is working to disrupt the school-to-prison pipeline by intervening where school discipline practices are overly punitive and disproportionately enforced against students of color. Our Employment Litigation Section has brought suits around the country to end discrimination in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hiring. And our Federal Coordination and Compliance Section is working to ensure that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and court services are available to those with limited English proficiency. For example, attorneys in FCS have worked with the U.S. Attorney's Office here in Colorado to secure a voluntary settlement agreement with the Supreme Court of Colorado to expand language assistance in court proceedings and programs. As a result of this case, limited English proficient persons throughout the state are entitled to interpreter or other language assistance so that they are able to participate meaningfully in all court matters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The department, and indeed the President, are committed to these issues, as well. The President yesterday highlighted several initiatives designed to rebuild trust between </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> departments and the communities they serve. He received the final report from his landmark White House Task Force on 21st Century Policing. He highlighted an open data project where technologists, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> associations, and community organizations will use data and technology to reduce use of force and increase transparency and he highlighted the recently created body worn camera toolkit. And he announced the launch of the law enforcement equipment review of federal programs that support acquisitions of equipment by state, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies. In March, former Attorney General Holder announced the six pilot cities for the new National Initiative for Building Community Trust and Justice, an innovative program designed to enhance procedural justice, reduce bias and support reconciliation between communities and law enforcement. Attorney General Lynch is dedicated to continuing the department's commitment to these issues. Today she is in Cincinnati launching a national tour promoting community policing and $163million in grant money available to advance the recommendations of the White House Task Force on 21st Century Policing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the local level, U.S. Attorney's Offices--including yours--have been meeting with law enforcement </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to promote community policing and anti-bias initiatives. Here in Colorado, U.S. Attorney John Walsh has emphasized the need for outreach to refugee communities as well as the importance of outreach to communities to prevent gang violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Importantly, we know that our reform work must go beyond the mechanics of good policing. We as a society must address the inequality and unfairness that pervade the larger criminal justice system. Often, an encounter with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is only the first contact in a process that involves prosecutors, defense attorneys, courts, correctional institutions and community supervision. Individuals experience these as facets of a unitary system, not as individual institutions. We cannot merely focus on reforming </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tactics without focusing on transforming broader criminal justice laws and priorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's why the Department of Justice has expanded its efforts in these other areas in recent years. Through the Smart on Crime Initiative, former Attorney General Holder instructed prosecutors to exercise their discretion to avoid charging low-level drug offenders with mandatory minimum sentences, resulting in the first drop in the federal prison population in 32 years, with no resulting increase in crime. U.S. Attorneys like John Walsh are at the forefront of the Department's Smart on Crime Initiative. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Along with the Access to Justice Initiative, the Civil Rights Division has advocated for increased resources for state public defense systems and for reform of local courts and jails that imprison individuals who are too poor to afford their fines. And we have brought a record number of suits to address conditions in America's jails and prisons, including the use of solitary confinement on juveniles and those with mental illness. Only by addressing the criminal justice system as a whole will be build the lasting trust between </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the communities that most need their services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So that's a small window into what we're doing in the policing and criminal justice areas. Ultimately, change requires commitment and work at the local level - through persistent and authentic engagement between law enforcement and the communities they serve. That is one of the reasons that we work so closely with U.S. Attorneys around the country and here in Denver. The U.S. Attorneys provide essential expertise and knowledge to the Division as we address similar issues in sometimes very different communities. John Walsh and his staff are crucial partners to the Civil Rights Division in this work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I would be remiss if I did not also tell you that John Walsh and his staff are crucial partners for the Civil Rights Division in civil rights matters beyond policing and criminal justice. John's staff has long collaborated with the division on a range of civil rights matters, most notably enforcement of the Americans with Disabilities Act. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before I leave, let me be clear about something: We can accomplish the sweeping reform I have discussed. In Portland, Oregon, for example, two and a half years after we identified an institutional pattern of excessive force against people with mental illness, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are being retrained, accountability measures implemented and the incidence of using force has dropped dramatically. And right next door in East Haven, Connecticut, residents are seeing transformative change in their </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> department just two years after the entry of a consent decree with the Justice Department. There is reason to be optimistic and believe that we can achieve reform that will keep individuals, communities and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> safe and ensure that communities have fair, impartial and constitutional policing. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is undoubtedly much work to be done but law enforcement and communities alike feel the urgency right now. The commitment of the Civil Rights Division, U.S. Attorneys and the Justice Department is part of this work, as is commitment by attorneys and local bar associations. Criminal justice reform at legislatures and city councils is part of this work. Strong law enforcement leadership throughout the country is part of this work. And the hard, authentic dialogue in communities all over the country with law enforcement is part of the work. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beyond the federal government and the legal community, there are concrete roles for people committed to improving </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-community relations, enabling racial reconciliation and promoting justice. It may seem trite but it is powerful when local communities and law enforcement engage directly and constructively with each other, when local leaders have relationships with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> chiefs, when we can understand each others' perspectives, each others' lives. This is hard, inglorious work, but it's essential. And there's a role here for anyone who wants a safer, fairer, more equal society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no problem too intractable or impossible for people committed to justice. Justice requires hope and hard, persistent work. We cannot sit idly by and hope that the public attention these issues are receiving will diminish, because they won't, or at least not for long. And so I thank you for your work and for your commitment to justice. Thank you.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Department of Justice has issued the following news release: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thank you to Constance Talmage, John Walsh and the Colorado Lawyers Committee for inviting me here today.  It's an honor to speak with you today about the work of the Civil Rights Division, particularly our work to ensure that policing is done in accordance with the Constitution and to help local </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> departments and the communities they serve build trust where it has eroded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eric Garner.  Michael Brown.  Tamir Rice.  John Crawford.  Walter Scott. Freddie Gray.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These names and many others have become familiar to us under tragic circumstances in recent months.  Their </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deaths</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and those of other unarmed African American men and women in encounters with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, have provoked widespread responses across the country and have fueled the Black Lives Matter movement.  In communities of color, in particular, the reaction has been stark and sobering. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the seven months I have been at the Civil Rights Division, I have spent a lot of time with local leaders and community members in cities all across America, including with numerous mothers who have lost their children in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-involved shootings.  The pain, anger, frustration--the lack of trust in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">--is real, and it is profound.  Again and again, people have told me that young people are losing faith in our justice system and view law enforcement as preying on them rather than protecting their loved ones.  They talk about how the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> don't value their rights, or indeed, their lives.  They talk about being tired of being viewed as criminals first, human beings second.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conversation in these rooms, however, is not about whether to have </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or not but about what kind of policing communities want and deserve. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no question that we need </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in our communities.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ensure the safety of our communities by patrolling neighborhoods, defending the rights of victims and deterring crime.  They are our first responders in many emergency situations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The overwhelming majority of the women and men who </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> our streets do their jobs with honor, pride and distinction.  Most of these individuals are driven to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> academy out of a commitment to public service and a desire to make an impact in their communities.  As the senseless and tragic assassinations of NYPD </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu this spring, the shooting of two </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Ferguson in March and the tragic injuries inflicted on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Baltimore a few weeks ago, remind us, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> do all of this at considerable risk to themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am struck everywhere I go by the wide gap in empathy and common language to discuss these problems.  Because in the very same cities and rooms where I speak with folks in the community, I hear from law enforcement who emphasize their responsibility to enforce the law and how they are doing the best job they can.  They feel attacked and undervalued.  They talk about how the actions of a few bad actors have tarnished the whole profession.  They talk about the fact that department budgets have been slashed over the last several years, resulting in drastic cuts for community policing and neighborhood patrols.  They talk about how they are constantly making split second decisions and people don't account for the thousands of times situations don't escalate and how the daily stress of their jobs take a toll.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there is one certain commonality in all rooms I am in.  And that is that everyone agrees that we are confronting grave challenges when it comes to the erosion of trust between </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the communities they serve throughout the United States.  The level of mistrust and resentment is unsettling.  Some, including NYPD Commissioner William Bratton, call it a &quot;crisis in American policing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The consequences of distrust between law enforcement and the communities they serve can be devastating.  Where people perceive the criminal justice system to be arbitrary, biased and unfair, they are less likely to cooperate with law enforcement, making us all less safe.  The distrust and alienation experienced in some communities can build into a powder keg of resentment, ready to be ignited by a single tragic incident.  We have seen this over and over--in Watts in 1965, in Los Angeles in 1992 and most recently, in Ferguson in 2014.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's worth asking, first, how did we get here?  And second, what are we going to do about it? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's start with the first question and consider the source of the mistrust.  Mistrust can't be explained away as the kneejerk reaction of the ill-informed or the hyperbolic.  It's in part the product of historical awareness about the role that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have played in enforcing and perpetuating slavery, the Black Codes, lynchings and Jim Crow segregation.  As FBI Director James Comey noted, &quot;At many points in American history, law enforcement enforced the status quo, a status quo that was often brutally unfair to disfavored groups.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is also the product of lived experience, of negative interactions that individuals -- or their family members, friends, or neighbors -- have had with law enforcement.  Something as quietly humiliating as being mistreated during a traffic stop, or being followed in a retail store.  These stories can circulate through a neighborhood -- or these days, across the nation via the web and social media -- and they can build up over time into a painful narrative that divides community members and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lack of trust also undeniably results from our criminal justice policies over the last few decades, and the concentrated impact they have had on communities of color and people living in poverty.  Law enforcement practices such as the stopping and frisking of young black men based on stereotypes.  Sentencing policies that result in mass incarceration, particularly of people of color.  And the devastating consequences that convictions have had on individuals' ability to find work, secure stable housing and reintegrate as full members of society.  These are deliberate policy choices that we made over the last several decades.  We bear the responsibility to confront their consequences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Civil Rights Division's investigation and recently released report on the Ferguson </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Department speaks to all of what I have been talking about.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Ferguson, we found a community where unlawful </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> practices have not only severely undermined the public trust and made local residents less safe - but created an intensely charged atmosphere where people feel under siege by those charged to serve and protect them. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We determined that the FPD engages in a pattern or practice of conduct that violates the United States Constitution and federal law.  Specifically, we found that Ferguson PD routinely:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Conducts stops without reasonable suspicion and arrests without probable cause, in violation of the Fourth Amendment;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Uses unreasonable force in violation of the Fourth Amendment;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Unlawfully interferes with First Amendment rights, including the right to record and to protest </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> activity;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Impermissibly discriminates against African Americans in violation of the 14th Amendment and federal statutory law; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Violates due process and equal protection in the operation of its Municipal Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We found that this unconstitutional conduct stems from the interaction of two dynamics:  Ferguson's undue focus on revenue generation through policing and pervasive racial bias in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> department and court system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These dynamics fostered unconstitutional practices at nearly every level of Ferguson's law enforcement system.  One example: During the summer of 2012, a Ferguson </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> detained a 32-year-old African American man who had just finished playing basketball at a park.  The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> approached while the man was sitting in his car, cooling off.  The car's windows appeared to be more heavily tinted than Ferguson's code allowed, so the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> may have had grounds to question him.  But, with no apparent justification, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> proceeded to escalate the situation, accusing the man of being a pedophile.  He prohibited the man from using his cell phone and ordered him out of his car for a pat-down search, even though he had no reason to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">suspect</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that the man was </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And when the man objected - citing his constitutional rights - the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> drew his gun, pointed it at the man's head and arrested him on eight different counts.  The arrest caused the man to lose his job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We observed that even minor code violations can sometimes result in multiple arrests, jail time and payments that exceed the cost of the original ticket many times over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, in 2007, one woman received two parking tickets that - together - totaled $152.  To date, she has paid $550 in fines and fees to the city of Ferguson.  She's been arrested twice for having unpaid tickets and she has spent six days in jail.  Yet she still - inexplicably - owes Ferguson $541.  Her story is only one of dozens of similar accounts that our investigation uncovered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By exposing the harm that the Ferguson court system causes, our findings report contributes to a growing understanding of a significant problem in our criminal justice system: the economic exploitation of the poor.  The use of modern-day debtors' prisons, the outsourcing of supervision to private probation companies, the imposition of fees on defendants to avail themselves of court-appointed attorneys and the right to a jury trial--these are dangerous trends that should concern us all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Ferguson, we also found evidence of unlawful discrimination.  African Americans make up 67% of the population, but from 2012 to 2014, they constituted:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    85% of the people subject to a vehicle stop;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    90% of people who received a citation; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    93% of people arrested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And discretionary </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> actions were overwhelmingly concentrated on the black population.  To take just one example, 95% of &quot;manner of walking in roadway&quot; charges--that's jaywalking--were levied against African Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We found racial disparities in virtually every available metric.  From 2012 to 2014, African Americans were more than twice as likely as white drivers to be searched during vehicle stops, but 26% less likely to be found in possession of contraband.  In 88% of cases in which FPD documented the use of force, force was used against African Americans.  In all cases in which canines were used against subjects for whom racial information is available, the subject was African American.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The evidence of racial bias comes not only from statistics, but also from remarks made by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> city and court officials.  Some of you may be aware of the emails we discovered during our investigation.  The emails were incontrovertible evidence of a culture that tolerated and perhaps even celebrated racial bias.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These findings reveal that the public trust in Ferguson law enforcement and its criminal justice system, especially among African Americans, was damaged long before August 2014.  When there is this level of broad community distrust, public safety suffers and the job of delivering </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> services is rendered more difficult and more dangerous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although we do not know what we will uncover in future investigations - and will never prejudge any outcome - in the weeks ahead, we pledge to bring the same rigor, the same fairness and the same impartiality to Baltimore, where the Division has launched a civil investigation into the Baltimore </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wherever this investigation may lead, our goal is to work with the community, public officials and law enforcement to help build a stronger, better Baltimore.  To restore trust where it has been badly eroded.  To promote healing - and address problems that are common to so many great cities across America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In many ways, Ferguson is not an anomaly.  Through our work around the country, we know there are similar </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and court practices in many places.  I also know of several </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> chiefs around the country that assigned the report as required reading for their </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We are already seeing the force multiplying effect of the report.  In the days subsequent to the issuance of our report, cities around the country are beginning to re-examine their policing and municipal court practices, though we know there is much more work to do.                 </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I said there were two questions--what the sources of mistrust are and what we are going to do about it.  The second question is hard but we have an unprecedented opportunity now to address fundamental problems in the way communities across the country interact with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and with the criminal justice system more generally. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the Civil Rights Division and others in this room and beyond have been working on policing issues for many years, the nation is paying attention because communities are demanding it.  The reality is we tend to confront systemic problems only when forced to by seemingly extraordinary events.  Journalists now are doing impressive investigative reporting on excessive force, racial profiling and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-community relations.  Universities are doing important research and analysis of these problems.  And families are talking about them at the dinner table.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Importantly, the focus on policing issues is happening in a broader conversation about the need to reform our criminal justice system.  There is no question, and I speak from personal experience, that 15 years ago, criminal justice reform was a lonely endeavor.  Few on the Left or the Right were willing to champion its cause.  Today, there is a widespread, even bipartisan, recognition that our criminal justice system needs an overhaul, that it should not be the go to answer for social problems and that mass incarceration has damaged this country in countless ways.  Law enforcement leaders themselves talk about how they have become first responders for a whole host of social problems, including homelessness, mental illness, drug dependency, school discipline.  And in too many places, the only response we have made available to them is arrest and incarceration as opposed to evidence-based, alternative interventions.  There is real reform taking place on broader criminal justice issues right now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For these reasons, we should be optimistic about this moment.  The public is engaged and there is an opportunity for real progress. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is the work ahead?  At the Civil Rights Division, we have redoubled our efforts to ensure that policing is done in accordance with the Constitution and to help local </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> departments and the communities they serve build trust where it has eroded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We can and do prosecute individual </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for intentional misconduct.  In fact, we have prosecuted nearly 400 law enforcement </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> over just the last six years for constitutional violations.                                                                                                           </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Criminal prosecution, however, is only one tool, and a limited one at that.  We also engage in systemic reform of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> departments, like in Ferguson.  Since the start of the administration, the Division has opened 22 investigations into </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> departments, including most recently the Baltimore City </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Department.  We also are currently enforcing 16 agreements with law enforcement agencies, including consent decrees in New Orleans, Puerto Rico, Seattle, Portland (Oregon), Detroit, the Virgin Islands, East Haven (Connecticut), Warren (Ohio), Albuquerque and Los Angeles.  The department currently has nine open investigations. In the majority of these investigations the Division has issued findings or technical assistance letters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The division is often invited into communities with the support of elected officials, law enforcement, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> unions and communities.  For example, two weeks ago, Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake invited the division to conduct a review of the Baltimore </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Department.  In response to the Mayor's request, Gene Ryan, president of the Baltimore City Fraternal Order of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lodge No. 3, released a statement, saying the union intends to &quot;fully cooperate with any investigation that has the potential to correct departmental deficiencies and improve the morale of our members . . . As the labor union that represents the nearly 3,000 active duty members of the agency, we agree with (the) mayor on her invitation to the Department of Justice and welcome their investigation fully as we, too, have issues with many of the current policies and procedures of the department.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Working together with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and community members, we are helping to change the way </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> services are delivered, to reduce the use of unnecessary force and to combat the influence of racial and ethnic bias in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> decision making.  We call the last five years of our work in this area &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reform 2.0&quot; because we learned a lot from the first 15 years of enforcement and we have incorporated lessons learned from that first decade and a half into our more recent efforts.  &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reform 2.0&quot; entails exhaustive engagement with the community through individual interviews and town hall meetings.  We meet with local officials and civil rights leaders.  We learn from law enforcement leaders.  And we spend a lot of time speaking with line </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers and with police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> unions.  Too often, they tell us that they lack adequate support, training, policy guidance, supervision and even equipment to keep them safe and allow them to engage in constitutional policing that keeps them and the public safe. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even after we announce our findings, we continue intensive engagement with all of the various stakeholders, including community leaders, line </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers and police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> unions to help shape the remedies that we negotiate at arm's length with city officials.  In Ferguson, we have met with several community groups and held an open community forum to learn how area residents wanted to see their </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> department and court system change.  Several weeks ago, our attorneys facilitated small group discussions, standing with an oversized notepad with marker in hand, taking down the groups' ideas.  In our view, this is how reform starts.  The stakeholders must feel investment in the remedies laid out in our agreements for them to be successful and sustainable. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Through this inclusive approach to reform, we have identified certain elements that are absolutely required to build trust and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> legitimacy where they have eroded.  For example, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> commanders must create opportunities for line </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to have positive interactions, outside of the enforcement context, with individuals they may encounter as victims, witnesses, or subjects.  This is a fundamental component of community policing.  Departments must also commit to transparency, because the more communities know about </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> activity, the more operations can reflect community values and priorities.  Structured community engagement is vital - there are a host of models for that and I know you will be having a panel about civilian oversight.  We need better research and data.  There is a lot we don't know that we should, so thoughtful data collection and analysis is a priority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There must be fair, consistent and robust internal and external systems of accountability so that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> departments can course correct when problems are identified.  Improper bias -- both explicit and implicit bias -- must be identified and corrected.  Critically, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> must be given the specialized training to do their jobs consistent with community values and the professional support to cope with stress and trauma they encounter on the job.  They need training to ensure de-escalation with the mentally ill and others in crisis, as well as to ensure respectful interactions with LGBTI, immigrants with language barriers and other vulnerable populations.  And procedural justice matters.  Research shows that being treated fairly and respectfully matters more than the ultimate result of a person's interaction with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We build these concepts into all of our consent decrees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the past three years, the division has successfully concluded the implementation of three consent decrees, as well as a memorandum of agreement.  Most recently, on May 11, 2015, the division and the U.S. Attorney's Office announced that the Missoula, Montana, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Department had fully implemented the requirements of its agreement with the department to improve the its response to reports of sexual assault.  The Missoula </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Department's successful implementation of the agreement in just two years illustrates the power of government, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and community leaders working together to create change that makes law enforcement and communities safer and stronger. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Civil Rights Division is also trying to address problems in policing from every angle.  For example, our Educational Opportunities Section is working to disrupt the school-to-prison pipeline by intervening where school discipline practices are overly punitive and disproportionately enforced against students of color.  Our Employment Litigation Section has brought suits around the country to end discrimination in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hiring.  And our Federal Coordination and Compliance Section is working to ensure that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and court services are available to those with limited English proficiency.  For example, attorneys in FCS have worked with the U.S. Attorney's Office here in Colorado to secure a voluntary settlement agreement with the Supreme Court of Colorado to expand language assistance in court proceedings and programs.  As a result of this case, limited English proficient persons throughout the state are entitled to interpreter or other language assistance so that they are able to participate meaningfully in all court matters.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The department, and indeed the President, are committed to these issues, as well. The President yesterday highlighted several initiatives designed to rebuild trust between </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> departments and the communities they serve. He received the final report from his landmark White House Task Force on 21st Century Policing. He highlighted an open data project where technologists, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> associations, and community organizations will use data and technology to reduce use of force and increase transparency and he highlighted the recently created body worn camera toolkit. And he announced the launch of the law enforcement equipment review of federal programs that support acquisitions of equipment by state, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies.  In March, former Attorney General Holder announced the six pilot cities for the new National Initiative for Building Community Trust and Justice, an innovative program designed to enhance procedural justice, reduce bias and support reconciliation between communities and law enforcement.  Attorney General Lynch is dedicated to continuing the department's commitment to these issues. Today she is in Cincinnati launching a national tour promoting community policing and $163million in grant money available to advance the recommendations of the White House Task Force on 21st Century Policing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the local level, U.S. Attorney's Offices--including yours--have been meeting with law enforcement </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to promote community policing and anti-bias initiatives.  Here in Colorado, U.S. Attorney John Walsh has emphasized the need for outreach to refugee communities as well as the importance of outreach to communities to prevent gang violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Importantly, we know that our reform work must go beyond the mechanics of good policing.  We as a society must address the inequality and unfairness that pervade the larger criminal justice system.  Often, an encounter with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is only the first contact in a process that involves prosecutors, defense attorneys, courts, correctional institutions and community supervision.  Individuals experience these as facets of a unitary system, not as individual institutions.  We cannot merely focus on reforming </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tactics without focusing on transforming broader criminal justice laws and priorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's why the Department of Justice has expanded its efforts in these other areas in recent years.  Through the Smart on Crime Initiative, former Attorney General Holder instructed prosecutors to exercise their discretion to avoid charging low-level drug offenders with mandatory minimum sentences, resulting in the first drop in the federal prison population in 32 years, with no resulting increase in crime.  U.S. Attorneys like John Walsh are at the forefront of the Department's Smart on Crime Initiative.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Along with the Access to Justice Initiative, the Civil Rights Division has advocated for increased resources for state public defense systems and for reform of local courts and jails that imprison individuals who are too poor to afford their fines.  And we have brought a record number of suits to address conditions in America's jails and prisons, including the use of solitary confinement on juveniles and those with mental illness.  Only by addressing the criminal justice system as a whole will be build the lasting trust between </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the communities that most need their services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So that's a small window into what we're doing in the policing and criminal justice areas.  Ultimately, change requires commitment and work at the local level - through persistent and authentic engagement between law enforcement and the communities they serve.  That is one of the reasons that we work so closely with U.S. Attorneys around the country and here in Denver.  The U.S. Attorneys provide essential expertise and knowledge to the Division as we address similar issues in sometimes very different communities.  John Walsh and his staff are crucial partners to the Civil Rights Division in this work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I would be remiss if I did not also tell you that John Walsh and his staff are crucial partners for the Civil Rights Division in civil rights matters beyond policing and criminal justice.  John's staff has long collaborated with the division on a range of civil rights matters, most notably enforcement of the Americans with Disabilities Act. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before I leave, let me be clear about something:  We can accomplish the sweeping reform I have discussed.  In Portland, Oregon, for example, two and a half years after we identified an institutional pattern of excessive force against people with mental illness, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are being retrained, accountability measures implemented and the incidence of using force has dropped dramatically.  And right next door in East Haven, Connecticut, residents are seeing transformative change in their </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> department just two years after the entry of a consent decree with the Justice Department.  There is reason to be optimistic and believe that we can achieve reform that will keep individuals, communities and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> safe and ensure that communities have fair, impartial and constitutional policing.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is undoubtedly much work to be done but law enforcement and communities alike feel the urgency right now.   The commitment of the Civil Rights Division, U.S. Attorneys and the Justice Department is part of this work, as is commitment by attorneys and local bar associations.  Criminal justice reform at legislatures and city councils is part of this work.  Strong law enforcement leadership throughout the country is part of this work.  And the hard, authentic dialogue in communities all over the country with law enforcement is part of the work.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beyond the federal government and the legal community, there are concrete roles for people committed to improving </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-community relations, enabling racial reconciliation and promoting justice.  It may seem trite but it is powerful when local communities and law enforcement engage directly and constructively with each other, when local leaders have relationships with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> chiefs, when we can understand each others' perspectives, each others' lives.  This is hard, inglorious work, but it's essential.  And there's a role here for anyone who wants a safer, fairer, more equal society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no problem too intractable or impossible for people committed to justice.  Justice requires hope and hard, persistent work.  We cannot sit idly by and hope that the public attention these issues are receiving will diminish, because they won't, or at least not for long.  And so I thank you for your work and for your commitment to justice.  Thank you.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> US Department of Justice, The Government of USA has issued the following news release: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thank you to Constance Talmage, John Walsh and the Colorado Lawyers Committee for inviting me here today. It's an honor to speak with you today about the work of the Civil Rights Division, particularly our work to ensure that policing is done in accordance with the Constitution and to help local </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> departments and the communities they serve build trust where it has eroded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eric Garner. Michael Brown. Tamir Rice. John Crawford. Walter Scott. Freddie Gray.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These names and many others have become familiar to us under tragic circumstances in recent months. Their </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deaths</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and those of other unarmed African American men and women in encounters with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, have provoked widespread responses across the country and have fueled the Black Lives Matter movement. In communities of color, in particular, the reaction has been stark and sobering. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the seven months I have been at the Civil Rights Division, I have spent a lot of time with local leaders and community members in cities all across America, including with numerous mothers who have lost their children in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-involved shootings. The pain, anger, frustration--the lack of trust in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">--is real, and it is profound. Again and again, people have told me that young people are losing faith in our justice system and view law enforcement as preying on them rather than protecting their loved ones. They talk about how the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> don't value their rights, or indeed, their lives. They talk about being tired of being viewed as criminals first, human beings second.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conversation in these rooms, however, is not about whether to have </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or not but about what kind of policing communities want and deserve. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no question that we need </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in our communities. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ensure the safety of our communities by patrolling neighborhoods, defending the rights of victims and deterring crime. They are our first responders in many emergency situations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The overwhelming majority of the women and men who </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> our streets do their jobs with honor, pride and distinction. Most of these individuals are driven to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> academy out of a commitment to public service and a desire to make an impact in their communities. As the senseless and tragic assassinations of NYPD </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu this spring, the shooting of two </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Ferguson in March and the tragic injuries inflicted on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Baltimore a few weeks ago, remind us, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> do all of this at considerable risk to themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am struck everywhere I go by the wide gap in empathy and common language to discuss these problems. Because in the very same cities and rooms where I speak with folks in the community, I hear from law enforcement who emphasize their responsibility to enforce the law and how they are doing the best job they can. They feel attacked and undervalued. They talk about how the actions of a few bad actors have tarnished the whole profession. They talk about the fact that department budgets have been slashed over the last several years, resulting in drastic cuts for community policing and neighborhood patrols. They talk about how they are constantly making split second decisions and people don't account for the thousands of times situations don't escalate and how the daily stress of their jobs take a toll.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there is one certain commonality in all rooms I am in. And that is that everyone agrees that we are confronting grave challenges when it comes to the erosion of trust between </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the communities they serve throughout the United States. The level of mistrust and resentment is unsettling. Some, including NYPD Commissioner William Bratton, call it a &quot;crisis in American policing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The consequences of distrust between law enforcement and the communities they serve can be devastating. Where people perceive the criminal justice system to be arbitrary, biased and unfair, they are less likely to cooperate with law enforcement, making us all less safe. The distrust and alienation experienced in some communities can build into a powder keg of resentment, ready to be ignited by a single tragic incident. We have seen this over and over--in Watts in 1965, in Los Angeles in 1992 and most recently, in Ferguson in 2014.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's worth asking, first, how did we get here? And second, what are we going to do about it? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's start with the first question and consider the source of the mistrust. Mistrust can't be explained away as the kneejerk reaction of the ill-informed or the hyperbolic. It's in part the product of historical awareness about the role that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have played in enforcing and perpetuating slavery, the Black Codes, lynchings and Jim Crow segregation. As FBI Director James Comey noted, &quot;At many points in American history, law enforcement enforced the status quo, a status quo that was often brutally unfair to disfavored groups.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is also the product of lived experience, of negative interactions that individuals -- or their family members, friends, or neighbors -- have had with law enforcement. Something as quietly humiliating as being mistreated during a traffic stop, or being followed in a retail store. These stories can circulate through a neighborhood -- or these days, across the nation via the web and social media -- and they can build up over time into a painful narrative that divides community members and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lack of trust also undeniably results from our criminal justice policies over the last few decades, and the concentrated impact they have had on communities of color and people living in poverty. Law enforcement practices such as the stopping and frisking of young black men based on stereotypes. Sentencing policies that result in mass incarceration, particularly of people of color. And the devastating consequences that convictions have had on individuals' ability to find work, secure stable housing and reintegrate as full members of society. These are deliberate policy choices that we made over the last several decades. We bear the responsibility to confront their consequences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Civil Rights Division's investigation and recently released report on the Ferguson </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Department speaks to all of what I have been talking about.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Ferguson, we found a community where unlawful </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> practices have not only severely undermined the public trust and made local residents less safe - but created an intensely charged atmosphere where people feel under siege by those charged to serve and protect them. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We determined that the FPD engages in a pattern or practice of conduct that violates the United States Constitution and federal law. Specifically, we found that Ferguson PD routinely:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Conducts stops without reasonable suspicion and arrests without probable cause, in violation of the Fourth Amendment;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Uses unreasonable force in violation of the Fourth Amendment;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unlawfully interferes with First Amendment rights, including the right to record and to protest </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> activity;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Impermissibly discriminates against African Americans in violation of the 14th Amendment and federal statutory law; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Violates due process and equal protection in the operation of its Municipal Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We found that this unconstitutional conduct stems from the interaction of two dynamics: Ferguson's undue focus on revenue generation through policing and pervasive racial bias in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> department and court system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These dynamics fostered unconstitutional practices at nearly every level of Ferguson's law enforcement system. One example: During the summer of 2012, a Ferguson </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> detained a 32-year-old African American man who had just finished playing basketball at a park. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> approached while the man was sitting in his car, cooling off. The car's windows appeared to be more heavily tinted than Ferguson's code allowed, so the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> may have had grounds to question him. But, with no apparent justification, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> proceeded to escalate the situation, accusing the man of being a pedophile. He prohibited the man from using his cell phone and ordered him out of his car for a pat-down search, even though he had no reason to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">suspect</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that the man was </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And when the man objected - citing his constitutional rights - the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> drew his gun, pointed it at the man's head and arrested him on eight different counts. The arrest caused the man to lose his job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We observed that even minor code violations can sometimes result in multiple arrests, jail time and payments that exceed the cost of the original ticket many times over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, in 2007, one woman received two parking tickets that - together - totaled $152. To date, she has paid $550 in fines and fees to the city of Ferguson. She's been arrested twice for having unpaid tickets and she has spent six days in jail. Yet she still - inexplicably - owes Ferguson $541. Her story is only one of dozens of similar accounts that our investigation uncovered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By exposing the harm that the Ferguson court system causes, our findings report contributes to a growing understanding of a significant problem in our criminal justice system: the economic exploitation of the poor. The use of modern-day debtors' prisons, the outsourcing of supervision to private probation companies, the imposition of fees on defendants to avail themselves of court-appointed attorneys and the right to a jury trial--these are dangerous trends that should concern us all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Ferguson, we also found evidence of unlawful discrimination. African Americans make up 67% of the population, but from 2012 to 2014, they constituted:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 85% of the people subject to a vehicle stop;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 90% of people who received a citation; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 93% of people arrested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And discretionary </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> actions were overwhelmingly concentrated on the black population. To take just one example, 95% of &quot;manner of walking in roadway&quot; charges--that's jaywalking--were levied against African Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We found racial disparities in virtually every available metric. From 2012 to 2014, African Americans were more than twice as likely as white drivers to be searched during vehicle stops, but 26% less likely to be found in possession of contraband. In 88% of cases in which FPD documented the use of force, force was used against African Americans. In all cases in which canines were used against subjects for whom racial information is available, the subject was African American.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The evidence of racial bias comes not only from statistics, but also from remarks made by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> city and court officials. Some of you may be aware of the emails we discovered during our investigation. The emails were incontrovertible evidence of a culture that tolerated and perhaps even celebrated racial bias.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These findings reveal that the public trust in Ferguson law enforcement and its criminal justice system, especially among African Americans, was damaged long before August 2014. When there is this level of broad community distrust, public safety suffers and the job of delivering </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> services is rendered more difficult and more dangerous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although we do not know what we will uncover in future investigations - and will never prejudge any outcome - in the weeks ahead, we pledge to bring the same rigor, the same fairness and the same impartiality to Baltimore, where the Division has launched a civil investigation into the Baltimore </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wherever this investigation may lead, our goal is to work with the community, public officials and law enforcement to help build a stronger, better Baltimore. To restore trust where it has been badly eroded. To promote healing - and address problems that are common to so many great cities across America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In many ways, Ferguson is not an anomaly. Through our work around the country, we know there are similar </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and court practices in many places. I also know of several </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> chiefs around the country that assigned the report as required reading for their </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We are already seeing the force multiplying effect of the report. In the days subsequent to the issuance of our report, cities around the country are beginning to re-examine their policing and municipal court practices, though we know there is much more work to do. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I said there were two questions--what the sources of mistrust are and what we are going to do about it. The second question is hard but we have an unprecedented opportunity now to address fundamental problems in the way communities across the country interact with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and with the criminal justice system more generally. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the Civil Rights Division and others in this room and beyond have been working on policing issues for many years, the nation is paying attention because communities are demanding it. The reality is we tend to confront systemic problems only when forced to by seemingly extraordinary events. Journalists now are doing impressive investigative reporting on excessive force, racial profiling and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-community relations. Universities are doing important research and analysis of these problems. And families are talking about them at the dinner table.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Importantly, the focus on policing issues is happening in a broader conversation about the need to reform our criminal justice system. There is no question, and I speak from personal experience, that 15 years ago, criminal justice reform was a lonely endeavor. Few on the Left or the Right were willing to champion its cause. Today, there is a widespread, even bipartisan, recognition that our criminal justice system needs an overhaul, that it should not be the go to answer for social problems and that mass incarceration has damaged this country in countless ways. Law enforcement leaders themselves talk about how they have become first responders for a whole host of social problems, including homelessness, mental illness, drug dependency, school discipline. And in too many places, the only response we have made available to them is arrest and incarceration as opposed to evidence-based, alternative interventions. There is real reform taking place on broader criminal justice issues right now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For these reasons, we should be optimistic about this moment. The public is engaged and there is an opportunity for real progress. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is the work ahead? At the Civil Rights Division, we have redoubled our efforts to ensure that policing is done in accordance with the Constitution and to help local </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> departments and the communities they serve build trust where it has eroded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We can and do prosecute individual </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for intentional misconduct. In fact, we have prosecuted nearly 400 law enforcement </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> over just the last six years for constitutional violations. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Criminal prosecution, however, is only one tool, and a limited one at that. We also engage in systemic reform of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> departments, like in Ferguson. Since the start of the administration, the Division has opened 22 investigations into </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> departments, including most recently the Baltimore City </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Department. We also are currently enforcing 16 agreements with law enforcement agencies, including consent decrees in New Orleans, Puerto Rico, Seattle, Portland (Oregon), Detroit, the Virgin Islands, East Haven (Connecticut), Warren (Ohio), Albuquerque and Los Angeles. The department currently has nine open investigations. In the majority of these investigations the Division has issued findings or technical assistance letters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The division is often invited into communities with the support of elected officials, law enforcement, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> unions and communities. For example, two weeks ago, Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake invited the division to conduct a review of the Baltimore </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Department. In response to the Mayor's request, Gene Ryan, president of the Baltimore City Fraternal Order of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lodge No. 3, released a statement, saying the union intends to &quot;fully cooperate with any investigation that has the potential to correct departmental deficiencies and improve the morale of our members . . . As the labor union that represents the nearly 3,000 active duty members of the agency, we agree with (the) mayor on her invitation to the Department of Justice and welcome their investigation fully as we, too, have issues with many of the current policies and procedures of the department.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Working together with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and community members, we are helping to change the way </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> services are delivered, to reduce the use of unnecessary force and to combat the influence of racial and ethnic bias in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> decision making. We call the last five years of our work in this area &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reform 2.0&quot; because we learned a lot from the first 15 years of enforcement and we have incorporated lessons learned from that first decade and a half into our more recent efforts. &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reform 2.0&quot; entails exhaustive engagement with the community through individual interviews and town hall meetings. We meet with local officials and civil rights leaders. We learn from law enforcement leaders. And we spend a lot of time speaking with line </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers and with police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> unions. Too often, they tell us that they lack adequate support, training, policy guidance, supervision and even equipment to keep them safe and allow them to engage in constitutional policing that keeps them and the public safe. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even after we announce our findings, we continue intensive engagement with all of the various stakeholders, including community leaders, line </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers and police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> unions to help shape the remedies that we negotiate at arm's length with city officials. In Ferguson, we have met with several community groups and held an open community forum to learn how area residents wanted to see their </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> department and court system change. Several weeks ago, our attorneys facilitated small group discussions, standing with an oversized notepad with marker in hand, taking down the groups' ideas. In our view, this is how reform starts. The stakeholders must feel investment in the remedies laid out in our agreements for them to be successful and sustainable. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Through this inclusive approach to reform, we have identified certain elements that are absolutely required to build trust and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> legitimacy where they have eroded. For example, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> commanders must create opportunities for line </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to have positive interactions, outside of the enforcement context, with individuals they may encounter as victims, witnesses, or subjects. This is a fundamental component of community policing. Departments must also commit to transparency, because the more communities know about </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> activity, the more operations can reflect community values and priorities. Structured community engagement is vital - there are a host of models for that and I know you will be having a panel about civilian oversight. We need better research and data. There is a lot we don't know that we should, so thoughtful data collection and analysis is a priority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There must be fair, consistent and robust internal and external systems of accountability so that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> departments can course correct when problems are identified. Improper bias -- both explicit and implicit bias -- must be identified and corrected. Critically, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> must be given the specialized training to do their jobs consistent with community values and the professional support to cope with stress and trauma they encounter on the job. They need training to ensure de-escalation with the mentally ill and others in crisis, as well as to ensure respectful interactions with LGBTI, immigrants with language barriers and other vulnerable populations. And procedural justice matters. Research shows that being treated fairly and respectfully matters more than the ultimate result of a person's interaction with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We build these concepts into all of our consent decrees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the past three years, the division has successfully concluded the implementation of three consent decrees, as well as a memorandum of agreement. Most recently, on May 11, 2015, the division and the U.S. Attorney's Office announced that the Missoula, Montana, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Department had fully implemented the requirements of its agreement with the department to improve the its response to reports of sexual assault. The Missoula </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Department's successful implementation of the agreement in just two years illustrates the power of government, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and community leaders working together to create change that makes law enforcement and communities safer and stronger. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Civil Rights Division is also trying to address problems in policing from every angle. For example, our Educational Opportunities Section is working to disrupt the school-to-prison pipeline by intervening where school discipline practices are overly punitive and disproportionately enforced against students of color. Our Employment Litigation Section has brought suits around the country to end discrimination in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hiring. And our Federal Coordination and Compliance Section is working to ensure that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and court services are available to those with limited English proficiency. For example, attorneys in FCS have worked with the U.S. Attorney's Office here in Colorado to secure a voluntary settlement agreement with the Supreme Court of Colorado to expand language assistance in court proceedings and programs. As a result of this case, limited English proficient persons throughout the state are entitled to interpreter or other language assistance so that they are able to participate meaningfully in all court matters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The department, and indeed the President, are committed to these issues, as well. The President yesterday highlighted several initiatives designed to rebuild trust between </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> departments and the communities they serve. He received the final report from his landmark White House Task Force on 21st Century Policing. He highlighted an open data project where technologists, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> associations, and community organizations will use data and technology to reduce use of force and increase transparency and he highlighted the recently created body worn camera toolkit. And he announced the launch of the law enforcement equipment review of federal programs that support acquisitions of equipment by state, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies. In March, former Attorney General Holder announced the six pilot cities for the new National Initiative for Building Community Trust and Justice, an innovative program designed to enhance procedural justice, reduce bias and support reconciliation between communities and law enforcement. Attorney General Lynch is dedicated to continuing the department's commitment to these issues. Today she is in Cincinnati launching a national tour promoting community policing and $163million in grant money available to advance the recommendations of the White House Task Force on 21st Century Policing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the local level, U.S. Attorney's Offices--including yours--have been meeting with law enforcement </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to promote community policing and anti-bias initiatives. Here in Colorado, U.S. Attorney John Walsh has emphasized the need for outreach to refugee communities as well as the importance of outreach to communities to prevent gang violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Importantly, we know that our reform work must go beyond the mechanics of good policing. We as a society must address the inequality and unfairness that pervade the larger criminal justice system. Often, an encounter with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is only the first contact in a process that involves prosecutors, defense attorneys, courts, correctional institutions and community supervision. Individuals experience these as facets of a unitary system, not as individual institutions. We cannot merely focus on reforming </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tactics without focusing on transforming broader criminal justice laws and priorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's why the Department of Justice has expanded its efforts in these other areas in recent years. Through the Smart on Crime Initiative, former Attorney General Holder instructed prosecutors to exercise their discretion to avoid charging low-level drug offenders with mandatory minimum sentences, resulting in the first drop in the federal prison population in 32 years, with no resulting increase in crime. U.S. Attorneys like John Walsh are at the forefront of the Department's Smart on Crime Initiative. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Along with the Access to Justice Initiative, the Civil Rights Division has advocated for increased resources for state public defense systems and for reform of local courts and jails that imprison individuals who are too poor to afford their fines. And we have brought a record number of suits to address conditions in America's jails and prisons, including the use of solitary confinement on juveniles and those with mental illness. Only by addressing the criminal justice system as a whole will be build the lasting trust between </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the communities that most need their services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So that's a small window into what we're doing in the policing and criminal justice areas. Ultimately, change requires commitment and work at the local level - through persistent and authentic engagement between law enforcement and the communities they serve. That is one of the reasons that we work so closely with U.S. Attorneys around the country and here in Denver. The U.S. Attorneys provide essential expertise and knowledge to the Division as we address similar issues in sometimes very different communities. John Walsh and his staff are crucial partners to the Civil Rights Division in this work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I would be remiss if I did not also tell you that John Walsh and his staff are crucial partners for the Civil Rights Division in civil rights matters beyond policing and criminal justice. John's staff has long collaborated with the division on a range of civil rights matters, most notably enforcement of the Americans with Disabilities Act. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before I leave, let me be clear about something: We can accomplish the sweeping reform I have discussed. In Portland, Oregon, for example, two and a half years after we identified an institutional pattern of excessive force against people with mental illness, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are being retrained, accountability measures implemented and the incidence of using force has dropped dramatically. And right next door in East Haven, Connecticut, residents are seeing transformative change in their </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> department just two years after the entry of a consent decree with the Justice Department. There is reason to be optimistic and believe that we can achieve reform that will keep individuals, communities and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> safe and ensure that communities have fair, impartial and constitutional policing. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is undoubtedly much work to be done but law enforcement and communities alike feel the urgency right now. The commitment of the Civil Rights Division, U.S. Attorneys and the Justice Department is part of this work, as is commitment by attorneys and local bar associations. Criminal justice reform at legislatures and city councils is part of this work. Strong law enforcement leadership throughout the country is part of this work. And the hard, authentic dialogue in communities all over the country with law enforcement is part of the work. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beyond the federal government and the legal community, there are concrete roles for people committed to improving </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-community relations, enabling racial reconciliation and promoting justice. It may seem trite but it is powerful when local communities and law enforcement engage directly and constructively with each other, when local leaders have relationships with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> chiefs, when we can understand each others' perspectives, each others' lives. This is hard, inglorious work, but it's essential. And there's a role here for anyone who wants a safer, fairer, more equal society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no problem too intractable or impossible for people committed to justice. Justice requires hope and hard, persistent work. We cannot sit idly by and hope that the public attention these issues are receiving will diminish, because they won't, or at least not for long. And so I thank you for your work and for your commitment to justice. Thank you.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> RICHMOND, CALIF.  </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7"> BODY:<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Residents packed the City Council chambers here in 2005, hoisting signs emblazoned with photos of slain loved ones. Eight men had been shot dead in gang-related violence in a two-week span.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many residents had long had contempt for the Richmond </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Department, with its decades-old reputation of racism and ruthlessness. The community rarely cooperated with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> making even minor crimes hard to solve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New to town, City Manager Bill Lindsay believed that change would come only with an overhaul of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> practices. He turned to an unlikely reformer: Chris Magnus, the white, gay </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> chief of Fargo, N.D.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A decade later, this minority-majority city has recorded its lowest homicide rate in 33 years. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-involved shootings are now rare: There have been two since Magnus came on board, whereas outside </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> agencies killed five men inside city limits during the same period.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Community mistrust has gradually given way to collaboration, thanks to deepening bonds between </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the neighborhoods they serve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, as angry residents riot over use of force in Baltimore -- and Ferguson, Mo., before that -- state and federal leaders are tapping Magnus, 54, to share his approach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Magnus acknowledges that the gains have involved some luck. But he and outside experts attribute them largely to a hard-won culture change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Residents have also stepped up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We changed some of the ideas the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had about us, and we changed some of the ideas we had about them,&quot; said Bennie Lois-Clark Singleton, 80, who participates in weekly street walks to coax at-risk youths to reject violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">--</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Positive interaction</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The video went viral. Two </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> working the annual Juneteenth festival were showing off their moves to the line-dance hit &quot;the Wobble.&quot; Onlookers hooted encouragement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The resident who captured the scene at the celebration of African American history later called it &quot;awesome&quot; to see how the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;were interacting with the community.&quot; But it wasn't always so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A shipbuilding hub during World War II, Richmond struggled when jobs vanished. The urban core is still depressed in this city of 107,571 -- more than 80% of whom are nonwhite -- and a dozen gangs remain active.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1982, minorities' relations with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> boiled over when tactics of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> known as &quot;the Cowboys&quot; came into wider light. Separate </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">fatal police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shootings of two black men in their beds led to a $3-million judgment, then the largest civil penalty in the country for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> abuse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A judge noted &quot;significant&quot; evidence of an informal policy that &quot;encouraged and authorized violence and brutality by Richmond </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against black residents.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As demographics shifted, problems persisted. In 2002, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> clearing a street on Cinco de Mayo roughed up and pepper-sprayed Andres Soto and his sons. In a holding cell, Soto found more than a dozen other Latino men swept up by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The community protested. The group won a settlement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That was the crack in the mirror,&quot; said Soto, 59, an environmental activist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two interim chiefs followed. Then, in December 2005, Lindsay hired Magnus, who had climbed the ranks in Lansing, Mich., before heading the force in Fargo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He just completely opened up the department,&quot; Soto said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">--</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New relationships</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Magnus arrived, he quickly realized he had to craft a command team committed to the vision of &quot;more human relationships,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were challenges. Soon after he took the post, seven high-ranking African American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sued, accusing Magnus of making racist comments and bypassing them for promotion. The case dragged on for years. After a three-month civil trial in 2012, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> lost on all 72 counts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All the while, the chief was pressing reforms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He disbanded roving street teams that had focused on arrests, replacing them with neighborhood-based policing. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> attend neighborhood meetings and give out their cellphone numbers. The department installed monitored street cameras and a gunfire detection system and employed sophisticated software to better predict and prevent crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On a recent shift, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chris Llamas edged his patrol car over the railroad tracks. Members of a Norteno gang had entered Sureno territory to leave their tag, which Surenos had crossed out and replaced with their own. It could easily escalate into shooting, the 13-year veteran concluded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Code enforcement workers now fall under Magnus' command, leading to quicker action on graffiti, drug houses and other blight. The tags would &quot;be gone by tomorrow,&quot; Llamas said after making a call. Soon, he and his partner were rousting public drinkers in a parking lot. A new merchants association had asked for help with the loitering, and received it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Enlisting community members as partners has also yielded benefits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richard Boyd, an organizer with Contra Costa Interfaith Supporting Community Organization, recalled that when he moved to Richmond, shortly before Magnus did, young men loitered in his neighborhood, flashing guns and shooting dice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was no genuine policing, there was no genuine street cleaning, road repair services,&quot; Boyd recalled. &quot;They wouldn't respond to any quality-of-life issues.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That soon changed. Though still troubled by violence, the Iron Triangle neighborhood has calmed noticeably, and families with children play in a radically revamped Nevin Park.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We were able ... to call [the beat </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">] directly and say, 'There are eight guys out front gambling,' &quot; Boyd recalled. &quot;And those </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would respond because they could feel our pain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Through Boyd's interfaith group, clergy lead the weekly street walks and participate in an anti-violence program known as Ceasefire, attending &quot;call-ins&quot; where </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are also present to persuade active members to give up gang life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I wouldn't call it trust, but they just know each other,&quot; said Tamisha Walker, 32, a one-time offender who runs a reentry program for former inmates. &quot;The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> know the guys on the street, they know their families, they know that they have kids, if they've been to school.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But work remains. &quot;It is individual </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and not the department as a whole that is respected,&quot; said Walker, who encourages offenders through Ceasefire to give up violence. &quot;We still have </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who we need to be careful about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Toody Maher concurs. In collaboration with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> her Pogo Park nonprofit transformed a blighted lot into a vibrant park that employs residents as monitors and won a national award.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sometimes the events on the ground don't correspond with the vision,&quot; she said, &quot;but thank God we have the vision.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">--</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Extra training</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> supervisors gathered for a routine meeting -- to pick apart every incident of force over a two-month period. Each tackle of a fleeing suspect, arm-twist and kick was up for scrutiny, though none had prompted complaints.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A woman outside an apartment where a kidnapping involving a gun was unfolding had refused three orders to move. When an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sought to arrest her, a physical struggle ensued. The incident, the group concurred, had stoked emotions and proved a poor use of resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a good big-picture training point,&quot; offered </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Steve Andretich, the use-of-force trainer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Maybe [the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">] could have said to the other witness, 'Hey, this is why we want you to move. Can you ask her?' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Weapons training has also expanded. Shooting-range sessions are held monthly to enhance precision. Quarterly, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> run through role-playing scenarios to help with split-second decisions on when to shoot and when to instead use Tasers, pepper spray or verbal persuasion, said Lt. Louie Tirona, the firearms instructor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are also taught to stop when a suspect complies, and Tirona said he has found that rounds fired have &quot;decreased noticeably,&quot; contributing to a higher survival rate of suspects. In four of the seven nonfatal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shootings under Magnus' watch, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> fired only one round.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Laurie Robinson, a professor of criminology at George Mason University who co-chaired the Presidential Task Force on 21st Century Policing -- convened in the wake of the Ferguson unrest -- called Richmond's monthly use-of-force reviews &quot;highly unusual.&quot; She said role-playing training, although more common in larger departments, puts Richmond on the &quot;leading edge of good practice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Magnus was one of &quot;the most impressive&quot; of the more than 120 people invited to testify before the task force, Robinson said, because he has forged collaborations with &quot;not just the residents but churches and schools and social services and businesses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, she said, it is the combination of reforms -- better training, community policing and new technologies -- that truly set Richmond apart and could prove a model for other departments large and small.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A national expert on recognizing implicit racial and gender bias conducted department-wide training in February.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Weeks earlier, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> filled a conference room for a meditation training geared to help them remain relaxed, alert and focused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sgt. Robert Gray, a 25-year veteran who proposed the training, said it would have been laughed at a decade ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The idea of old-school cops, he said, &quot;was to get the bad guys, get them to comply, and if that takes physical coercion, so be it. That's not the way to be, especially when you serve the community. And that's what we are -- servants.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last September, after the city had gone seven years without a fatality, a Richmond </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shot and killed Pedie Perez, 24, contending that Perez grabbed for his gun. Perez's family disputes that version and has sued. An investigation is ongoing. Body cameras have since arrived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Magnus knew community relations were at risk. He informed the public that it could attend the coroner's inquest; posted updates on social media; and was present at Perez's funeral at the family's invitation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last winter, the chief joined community members demonstrating in the wake of the Ferguson unrest and held a &quot;Black Lives Matter&quot; sign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Richmond </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police Officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Assn. bristled, accusing him of illegally participating in political activities while in uniform. Magnus countered that he was merely acknowledging that &quot;all lives matter&quot; and showing respect &quot;for the very real concerns of our minority communities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boyd did a double-take when Magnus reached for the sign but said he was not surprised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He had first met Magnus at a march to the scene of a slaying that, it turned out, had occurred in Magnus' neighborhood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was this &quot;blond-haired white guy going on about how he had heard the shots from his house,&quot; Boyd said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sometimes I think he doesn't know he's the chief. He thinks he's one of us.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7"> BODY:<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Residents packed the City Council chambers here in 2005, hoisting signs emblazoned with photos of slain loved ones. Eight men had been shot dead in gang-related violence in a two-week span.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many residents had long had contempt for the Richmond </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Department, with its decades-old reputation of racism and ruthlessness. The community rarely cooperated with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> making even minor crimes hard to solve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New to town, City Manager Bill Lindsay believed that change would come only with an overhaul of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> practices. He turned to an unlikely reformer: Chris Magnus, the white, gay </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> chief of Fargo, N.D.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A decade later, this minority-majority city has recorded its lowest homicide rate in 33 years. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-involved shootings are now rare: There have been two since Magnus came on board, whereas outside </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> agencies killed five men inside city limits during the same period.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Community mistrust has gradually given way to collaboration, thanks to deepening bonds between </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the neighborhoods they serve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, as angry residents riot over use of force in Baltimore -- and Ferguson, Mo., before that -- state and federal leaders are tapping Magnus, 54, to share his approach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Magnus acknowledges that the gains have involved some luck. But he and outside experts attribute them largely to a hard-won culture change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Residents have also stepped up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We changed some of the ideas the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had about us, and we changed some of the ideas we had about them,&quot; said Bennie Lois-Clark Singleton, 80, who participates in weekly street walks to coax at-risk youths to reject violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">--</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Positive interaction</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The video went viral. Two </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> working the annual Juneteenth festival were showing off their moves to the line-dance hit &quot;the Wobble.&quot; Onlookers hooted encouragement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The resident who captured the scene at the celebration of African American history later called it &quot;awesome&quot; to see how the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;were interacting with the community.&quot; But it wasn't always so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A shipbuilding hub during World War II, Richmond struggled when jobs vanished. The urban core is still depressed in this city of 107,571 -- more than 80% of whom are nonwhite -- and a dozen gangs remain active.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1982, minorities' relations with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> boiled over when tactics of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> known as &quot;the Cowboys&quot; came into wider light. Separate </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">fatal police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shootings of two black men in their beds led to a $3-million judgment, then the largest civil penalty in the country for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> abuse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A judge noted &quot;significant&quot; evidence of an informal policy that &quot;encouraged and authorized violence and brutality by Richmond </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against black residents.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As demographics shifted, problems persisted. In 2002, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> clearing a street on Cinco de Mayo roughed up and pepper-sprayed Andres Soto and his sons. In a holding cell, Soto found more than a dozen other Latino men swept up by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The community protested. The group won a settlement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That was the crack in the mirror,&quot; said Soto, 59, an environmental activist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two interim chiefs followed. Then, in December 2005, Lindsay hired Magnus, who had climbed the ranks in Lansing, Mich., before heading the force in Fargo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He just completely opened up the department,&quot; Soto said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">--</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New relationships</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Magnus arrived, he quickly realized he had to craft a command team committed to the vision of &quot;more human relationships,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were challenges. Soon after he took the post, seven high-ranking African American </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sued, accusing Magnus of making racist comments and bypassing them for promotion. The case dragged on for years. After a three-month civil trial in 2012, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> lost on all 72 counts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All the while, the chief was pressing reforms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He disbanded roving street teams that had focused on arrests, replacing them with neighborhood-based policing. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> attend neighborhood meetings and give out their cellphone numbers. The department installed monitored street cameras and a gunfire detection system and employed sophisticated software to better predict and prevent crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On a recent shift, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chris Llamas edged his patrol car over the railroad tracks. Members of a Norteno gang had entered Sureno territory to leave their tag, which Surenos had crossed out and replaced with their own. It could easily escalate into shooting, the 13-year veteran concluded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Code enforcement workers now fall under Magnus' command, leading to quicker action on graffiti, drug houses and other blight. The tags would &quot;be gone by tomorrow,&quot; Llamas said after making a call. Soon, he and his partner were rousting public drinkers in a parking lot. A new merchants association had asked for help with the loitering, and received it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Enlisting community members as partners has also yielded benefits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richard Boyd, an organizer with Contra Costa Interfaith Supporting Community Organization, recalled that when he moved to Richmond, shortly before Magnus did, young men loitered in his neighborhood, flashing guns and shooting dice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was no genuine policing, there was no genuine street cleaning, road repair services,&quot; Boyd recalled. &quot;They wouldn't respond to any quality-of-life issues.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That soon changed. Though still troubled by violence, the Iron Triangle neighborhood has calmed noticeably, and families with children play in a radically revamped Nevin Park.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We were able ... to call [the beat </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">] directly and say, 'There are eight guys out front gambling,' &quot; Boyd recalled. &quot;And those </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would respond because they could feel our pain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Through Boyd's interfaith group, clergy lead the weekly street walks and participate in an anti-violence program known as Ceasefire, attending &quot;call-ins&quot; where </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are also present to persuade active members to give up gang life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I wouldn't call it trust, but they just know each other,&quot; said Tamisha Walker, 32, a one-time offender who runs a reentry program for former inmates. &quot;The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> know the guys on the street, they know their families, they know that they have kids, if they've been to school.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But work remains. &quot;It is individual </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and not the department as a whole that is respected,&quot; said Walker, who encourages offenders through Ceasefire to give up violence. &quot;We still have </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who we need to be careful about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Toody Maher concurs. In collaboration with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> her Pogo Park nonprofit transformed a blighted lot into a vibrant park that employs residents as monitors and won a national award.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sometimes the events on the ground don't correspond with the vision,&quot; she said, &quot;but thank God we have the vision.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">--</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Extra training</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> supervisors gathered for a routine meeting -- to pick apart every incident of force over a two-month period. Each tackle of a fleeing suspect, arm-twist and kick was up for scrutiny, though none had prompted complaints.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A woman outside an apartment where a kidnapping involving a gun was unfolding had refused three orders to move. When an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sought to arrest her, a physical struggle ensued. The incident, the group concurred, had stoked emotions and proved a poor use of resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a good big-picture training point,&quot; offered </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Steve Andretich, the use-of-force trainer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Maybe [the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">] could have said to the other witness, 'Hey, this is why we want you to move. Can you ask her?' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Weapons training has also expanded. Shooting-range sessions are held monthly to enhance precision. Quarterly, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> run through role-playing scenarios to help with split-second decisions on when to shoot and when to instead use Tasers, pepper spray or verbal persuasion, said Lt. Louie Tirona, the firearms instructor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are also taught to stop when a suspect complies, and Tirona said he has found that rounds fired have &quot;decreased noticeably,&quot; contributing to a higher survival rate of suspects. In four of the seven nonfatal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shootings under Magnus' watch, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> fired only one round.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Laurie Robinson, a professor of criminology at George Mason University who co-chaired the Presidential Task Force on 21st Century Policing -- convened in the wake of the Ferguson unrest -- called Richmond's monthly use-of-force reviews &quot;highly unusual.&quot; She said role-playing training, although more common in larger departments, puts Richmond on the &quot;leading edge of good practice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Magnus was one of &quot;the most impressive&quot; of the more than 120 people invited to testify before the task force, Robinson said, because he has forged collaborations with &quot;not just the residents but churches and schools and social services and businesses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, she said, it is the combination of reforms -- better training, community policing and new technologies -- that truly set Richmond apart and could prove a model for other departments large and small.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A national expert on recognizing implicit racial and gender bias conducted department-wide training in February.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Weeks earlier, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> filled a conference room for a meditation training geared to help them remain relaxed, alert and focused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sgt. Robert Gray, a 25-year veteran who proposed the training, said it would have been laughed at a decade ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The idea of old-school cops, he said, &quot;was to get the bad guys, get them to comply, and if that takes physical coercion, so be it. That's not the way to be, especially when you serve the community. And that's what we are -- servants.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last September, after the city had gone seven years without a fatality, a Richmond </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shot and killed Pedie Perez, 24, contending that Perez grabbed for his gun. Perez's family disputes that version and has sued. An investigation is ongoing. Body cameras have since arrived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Magnus knew community relations were at risk. He informed the public that it could attend the coroner's inquest; posted updates on social media; and was present at Perez's funeral at the family's invitation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last winter, the chief joined community members demonstrating in the wake of the Ferguson unrest and held a &quot;Black Lives Matter&quot; sign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Richmond </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police Officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Assn. bristled, accusing him of illegally participating in political activities while in uniform. Magnus countered that he was merely acknowledging that &quot;all lives matter&quot; and showing respect &quot;for the very real concerns of our minority communities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boyd did a double-take when Magnus reached for the sign but said he was not surprised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He had first met Magnus at a march to the scene of a slaying that, it turned out, had occurred in Magnus' neighborhood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was this &quot;blond-haired white guy going on about how he had heard the shots from his house,&quot; Boyd said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sometimes I think he doesn't know he's the chief. He thinks he's one of us.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TAHLEQUAH - The Tahlequah </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Department identified a 15-year department veteran on Tuesday as the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who fatally shot a 35-year-old man during an altercation that was captured on another </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> body camera Saturday morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Randy Tanner, the agency's range master, remains on administrative leave while the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation completes an inquiry into the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of Joshua P. Crittenden, Tahlequah </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chief Nate King said at a news conference.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Around 11:50 a.m. Saturday, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> went to a home in the 500 block of South Mission Avenue in response to a call indicating that two men had at least one gun in a white pickup that had been reported stolen, King said. The caller reported that the men had been fighting, he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benjamin Brown, who was at the scene and was arrested on multiple felony warrants, gave </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a fictitious name of the person who had been in the pickup with him, King said. Brown's father lives at the home where the shooting occurred, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others who were in the home Saturday morning told </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> no one else was inside, but the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> looked through the house because they believed the other </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">suspect</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - Crittenden - was </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The footage provided to reporters was from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bronson McNiel's body camera. McNiel was riding in a patrol car with Tanner the day of the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Come here, partner,&quot; one </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> can be heard telling one of the men, believed to be Brown. &quot;Let's get your hands up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All four </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at the scene were equipped with body cameras, but Tanner - originally only there in an observer role - did not activate his, King said. He also said another camera's lens was obscured and that the fourth did not capture footage until after the shooting occurred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All Tahlequah </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have had body cameras since August 2014, King said, but whether they are required to be turned on depends on the situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A call of this nature, with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tanner as an observing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a training </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by the time it escalated, his body was in fight or flight,&quot; he said. &quot;I'm not sure if I myself would have remembered to turn that camera on at that time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> reported finding Crittenden when he went through an attic vent on the home's south end, and they can be heard telling dispatchers he was in the attic with a weapon. The other occupants of the home &quot;did not follow directions to remain in place on the back porch, causing the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> further safety concerns,&quot; King said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> can be heard saying he was concerned that Crittenden would jump into the home from a hallway attic access, using a flashlight to show the area in question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting can be heard but not seen on the recording, which also did not capture the altercation between Tanner and Crittenden that led to shots being fired. Tanner reported drawing his Taser to subdue Crittenden &quot;until he discovered Crittenden did in fact have a handgun,&quot; King said, and that prompted the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to draw his gun, instead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">King said Crittenden pointed his gun at Tanner multiple times. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> can be heard yelling that Crittenden had jumped out of the attic shortly before the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He jumped. I can't radio. I'm on the wrong channel to tell them,&quot; one </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> identified as Pam Bell, can be heard saying. &quot;He's got a pistol. He's jumped. I believe he did! ... Shots! Shots!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 12:14 p.m., six shots are heard from the home's southeast corner. Eight seconds later, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are heard saying, &quot;We have a suspect down.&quot; An ambulance arrived about eight minutes later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crittenden did not shoot at Tanner, but King said he had &quot;no doubt&quot; that he would have done so if given the opportunity, adding that Crittenden had been told &quot;on multiple occasions&quot; to drop his weapon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OSBI Special Agent Charlie Mackey said investigators found a handgun near Crittenden after he was shot. King said the camera footage shows that Crittenden's gun had its safety in the &quot;off&quot; position and that one of the bullets hit the middle knuckle of Crittenden's right hand - indicating, he said, that Crittenden was holding his gun in front of him at the time he was shot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(Tanner) stated he was in fear of his life and believed using deadly force was his only option,&quot; King said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crittenden was transported to a Tulsa hospital, where he died, authorities said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown remains in Cherokee County custody, jail records show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tanner was the only </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who fired, King said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I feel like they acted decisively in a very dangerous and in a rapidly escalating situation,&quot; King said of his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;They made several attempts to end this situation peaceably, ... and he refused to do so time and time again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The OSBI will send a report on its findings to the Cherokee County District Attorney's Office, who will determine whether Tanner's use of deadly force was justified, Mackey said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">King said Crittenden's family, whom he knew personally, have seen the body camera video.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Family members of both men told the Tulsa World on Tuesday that they didn't wish to comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a tragedy in Tahlequah, no matter how it plays out, no matter what happened,&quot; King said. &quot;A man lost his life. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that were involved in this (and) I myself, we will never be the same the rest of our lives.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7"> BODY:<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EDMONTON * The suspect in a shooting that killed an Edmonton </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and wounded another had been the focus of a lengthy hate crimes investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chief Rod Knecht says </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had evidence going back to February of last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The online hatred and bullying of an Edmonton family had become extreme and the family members were increasingly worried about their personal safety, at which time the Edmonton </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Service became involved,&quot; Knecht said at a Tuesday news conference</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Knecht identified the suspect as Norman Walter Raddatz, 42, who was known to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> although he did not have an extensive criminal record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had gone to the man's home in west Edmonton on Monday night to arrest him on an outstanding warrant for a bylaw offence. There were also going to serve him with documents ordering him to appear in court for criminal harassment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's when gunfire broke out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Knecht said eight </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> approached the door of the home but did not expect violence. They knocked and announced themselves as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and, when no one answered, they started to break in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bullets flew through the door and the first </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in line, 38-year-old Sgt. Jason Harley, was shot once in the lower back as he turned around, said Knecht. Body armour saved Harley's life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Const. Daniel Woodall, 35, was also wearing a vest but was hit with bullets elsewhere on his body and suffered a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">fatal,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;catastrophic wound.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Knecht said the other </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> took cover and were pinned down by gunfire for the next 10 minutes. They came &quot;very, very close to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> found 53 bullets in the house and garage across the street, said Knecht, who added the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> didn't fire any rounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Investigators believe Raddatz used a large-bore rifle, a powerful gun that carries big bullets and is often used to hunt big game animals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soon after, a fire started in the house and burned it to the ground. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> found a body in the basement they believe is Raddatz. An autopsy was to be performed Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Knecht said </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are not looking for other suspects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Woodall was recruited to the Edmonton force from Great Britain and had served with the Greater Manchester </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He had been an Edmonton </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for eight years and was assigned to the hate crimes unit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He leaves behind a wife, Claire, and two young children. Knecht said the children were sleeping last night and their mother was to break the news to them Tuesday morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Twitter, she thanked people for the support she has received.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Your generous outpouring of love for myself and my boys fills my heart. He is my hero, our boys' hero &amp;; Edmonton's newest hero,&quot; she wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Edmonton Mayor Don Iveson choked back tears and struggled to talk to reporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I reflect the sadness that I feel in the community,&quot; he said. &quot;But I feel this most deeply as a father of young children and I'm incredibly sad for them and for Mrs. Woodall.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Edmonton is still a safe city, he said. &quot;By and large, good people live here ... we rely on our </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to protect us from the few and the worst among us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prime Minister Stephen Harper also sent condolences to Woodall's family, friends and colleagues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is a very difficult reminder that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> across our country put their lives on the line every day to serve and protect our communities and keep us safe,&quot; Harper said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is the second </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of an Edmonton-area </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> this year. RCMP Const. David Wynn, 42, died in January at a casino in St. Albert, north of the city, while trying to track down the driver of a stolen truck. Auxiliary Const. Derek Bond was seriously injured but survived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooter, Shawn Maxwell Rehn, was out on bail facing 15 charges, including escaping lawful custody, possession of a prohibited firearm and failure to show up for a previous bail hearing on the charges. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> found him dead in a home he had broken into.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The last </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to be killed on the job within Edmonton city limits was Const. Ezio Faraone, who was gunned down in June 1990 while trying to arrest a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">suspect</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who was fleeing from an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> robbery. !@COPYRIGHT=&copy; 2015 Times &amp;; Transcript (Moncton)</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An armed policeman murdered a man during an operation after firing six shots into him from close range, a court has heard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anthony Long blasted eight shots into a VW Golf carrying a number of suspected armed robber, six of which hit Azelle Rodney, jurors were told.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two of the bullets were fired into the top of the victim's head, causing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">fatal</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> injuries, the Old Bailey heard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had swarmed the car in a 'hard stop' after believing those inside were armed with guns and on their way to commit a robbery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Old Bailey heard how Long was a Specialist Firearms </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (SFO), known as 'E7', at the Metropolitan </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'SO19' division when he shot and killed Mr Rodney on 30 April 2005, in Hale Lane, in Mill Hill, North London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutor Max Hill, QC, said: &quot;The prosecution say that it was not necessary for Mr Long to open fire upon the Golf and Azelle Rodney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Therefore, we say, Mr Long was not acting lawfully when he opened fire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That being so, Mr Long's actions in deliberately killing Azelle Rodney when it was not necessary to do so, make Mr Long guilty of murder.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court heard Mr Rodney was sat in the rear passenger seat, behind Wesley Lovell and Frank Graham, when armed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> swooped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> suspected the Golf contained firearms and the men were on their way to commit an armed robbery, said the prosecutor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> set up surveillance on the car and a specialist firearms team was deployed in unmarked cars to follow the vehicle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prosecutor said: &quot;As the Golf drove along Hale Lane, the order was given by the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in charge of the firearms team to carry out what is known as a &quot;hard stop&quot;, during which the Golf was to be forced to a halt and boxed in by the unmarked </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> vehicles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The hard stop was carried out in Hale Lane, with the result that one of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> firearms vehicles drew alongside the driver's side of the Golf.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The front seat passenger in that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> firearms car was the defendant Mr Long, who opened fire and shot and killed Azelle Rodney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mr Long fired eight shots, from short range and in quick succession, all of which were aimed at Azelle Rodney, though two lodged in the metalwork of the car door or missed, therefore six of the eight reached him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The majority of those shots caused </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">fatal</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> injuries to Azelle Rodney, culminating in the final two shots which were fired into the top of Azelle Rodney's head.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Hill told jurors they would need to 'consider very carefully' the actions of Long and the events surrounding the moment he 'pulled the trigger and opened fire' on the alleged victim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Long sat in the glass-enclosed dock of the Old Bailey's Court 10 wearing a grey suit, pale blue shirt and navy blue patterned tie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Rodney's family members, including mum Susan Alexander sat in the well of the court as the prosecution opened the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Long, whose bail address was given in court as the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Federation Headquarters (Room 26), Federation House, Highbury Drive, Leatherhead, Surrey denies murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial continues.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EDMONTON * The suspect in a shooting that killed an Edmonton </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and wounded another had been the focus of a lengthy hate crimes investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chief Rod Knecht says </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had evidence going back to February of last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The online hatred and bullying of an Edmonton family had become extreme and the family members were increasingly worried about their personal safety, at which time the Edmonton </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Service became involved,&quot; Knecht said at a Tuesday news conference</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Knecht identified the suspect as Norman Walter Raddatz, 42, who was known to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> although he did not have an extensive criminal record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had gone to the man's home in west Edmonton on Monday night to arrest him on an outstanding warrant for a bylaw offence. There were also going to serve him with documents ordering him to appear in court for criminal harassment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's when gunfire broke out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Knecht said eight </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> approached the door of the home but did not expect violence. They knocked and announced themselves as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and, when no one answered, they started to break in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bullets flew through the door and the first </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in line, 38-year-old Sgt. Jason Harley, was shot once in the lower back as he turned around, said Knecht. Body armour saved Harley's life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Const. Daniel Woodall, 35, was also wearing a vest but was hit with bullets elsewhere on his body and suffered a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">fatal,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;catastrophic wound.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Knecht said the other </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> took cover and were pinned down by gunfire for the next 10 minutes. They came &quot;very, very close to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> found 53 bullets in the house and garage across the street, said Knecht, who added the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> didn't fire any rounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Investigators believe Raddatz used a large-bore rifle, a powerful gun that carries big bullets and is often used to hunt big game animals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soon after, a fire started in the house and burned it to the ground. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> found a body in the basement they believe is Raddatz. An autopsy was to be performed Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Knecht said </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are not looking for other suspects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Woodall was recruited to the Edmonton force from Great Britain and had served with the Greater Manchester </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He had been an Edmonton </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for eight years and was assigned to the hate crimes unit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He leaves behind a wife, Claire, and two young children. Knecht said the children were sleeping last night and their mother was to break the news to them Tuesday morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Twitter, she thanked people for the support she has received.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Your generous outpouring of love for myself and my boys fills my heart. He is my hero, our boys' hero &amp;; Edmonton's newest hero,&quot; she wrote.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I reflect the sadness that I feel in the community,&quot; he said. &quot;But I feel this most deeply as a father of young children and I'm incredibly sad for them and for Mrs. Woodall.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prime Minister Stephen Harper also sent condolences to Woodall's family, friends and colleagues.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Malacanang has condemned in the strongest terms the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">fatal</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shooting of Vice Mayor Florante Raspado of Jones in Isabela province on Friday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Presidential Communications Secretary Herminio Coloma Jr. stressed that violence has no place in Philippine politics and Filipinos are set to elect their leaders in less than a year from now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Siyempre po ayaw po natin 'yung ano mang banta sa katahimikan at kaayusan ng ating mga komunidad (Of course, we do not like any kind of threats to peace and order in our community),&quot; Coloma told government-run dzRB radio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Hindi po natin dapat bigyan ng puwang [ang karahasan] at hindi rin po katanggap-tanggap na dahilan 'yung pulitika dahil ang pulitika naman po natin ay dapat ding isagawa nang naaayon sa batas (We should give violence a space and politics is not an acceptable reason for violence because politics should be done according to what the law dictates),&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Coloma said as far as the killing of Raspado is concerned, the Philippine National </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> should conduct a comprehensive investigation of the incident and bring the killers to justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Friday, Acting Isabela </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> director Senior Supt. Amorsolo dela Cruz, said in an interview over dzBB said the two suspected gunmen of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">fatal</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shooting of Raspado were arrested after pursuing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> caught up with their getaway vehicle \x96 a red Mitsubishi Adventure - along the highway going to Quirino.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dela Cruz said the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">suspects</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who were </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with M16 rifles, jumped out of their van and then engaged the pursuing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in a brief gun fight.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A bipartisan group of Maryland lawmakers on Monday will begin its work to develop recommendations for improving </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> training and enhancing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-community relations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The legislative panel was formed last month by House Speaker Michael E. Busch (D-Anne Arundel) and Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller Jr. (D-Calvert) and tasked with providing the General Assembly legislative proposals to improve public safety and policing practices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The committee's effort comes six weeks after riots broke out in Baltimore after the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old black man who suffered a severe spinal cord injury while in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> custody. Gray died a week after sustaining the injury. Six Baltimore </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have been charged in connection with his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Sen. Catherine E. Pugh (D-Baltimore), who walked throughout Baltimore trying to spread calm during the state of emergency imposed because of the unrest, will be the work group's co-chairperson. She said she looks forward to developing strong proposals that will change how </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are hired and how they interact with residents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm hoping that during the process that we don't rush,&quot; Pugh said. &quot;I want to continue until we are sure that there is a sound policy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pugh said that the committee, which will hold an organizational meeting Monday, will hear from community groups, law enforcement agencies and criminal justice advocates. It will review </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> training and hiring practices, the role of independent review boards investigating shootings and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deaths</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> involving </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Maryland's Law Enforcement </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Officers'</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bill of Rights, which among other things gives </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 10 days to secure representation before cooperating with an investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pugh said she is particularly interested in reviewing diversity training for law enforcement </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and looking at how often </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have psychiatric evaluations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Sen. Jamie B. Raskin (D-Montgomery), who will be part of the 20-member group, said it will build off the progress the General Assembly made this year enacting some criminal justice reforms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is this bipartisan consensus that too many people are being swept up in the process for nonviolent and victimless offenses,&quot; Raskin said. That, he said, helped lead to the passage of several bills designed to help ex-offenders turn their lives around.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among them was one giving former offenders the ability to expunge some of their criminal records or shield long-ago or minor convictions from public view. Gov. Larry Hogan (R) vetoed a different measure that would have allowed felons who are on parole and probation to vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The conversation about criminal justice reform is taking place at a moment of fallen crime rates, so we are able to take a deep breath and examine what is working and what's not,&quot; Raskin said. &quot;Meanwhile, the advent of cellphone photography also changed the public conversation about </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-community relationships. Several of these very high-profile incidents from across the country have spotlighted that there is still a lot of progress to be made.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year, the legislature approved a bill that sets the stage for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to wear body cameras. A commission will be formed to review best practices for using the cameras and set statewide policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pugh said that because that commission has taken on the issue of body cameras, the work group can look at other topics involving </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> interaction with communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Criminal justice advocates have criticized the General Assembly for watering down or killing legislation dealing with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> conduct, including a measure that would have required the state prosecutor to investigate all </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-involved </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deaths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Del. Brett R. Wilson, an assistant state's attorney who is part of the work group, said he has asked the panel to gather information about </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-involved shootings and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deaths</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> across the state. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need the numbers so we are dealing with facts, not anecdotes,&quot; said Wilson (R-Washington). He wants to look into the circumstances of each </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-involved </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the race of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">victim and whether the victim was armed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we start from there, then we can look at the causes - was it a lapse of training, overzealousness or something else?&quot; Wilson said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DUBLIN -- A BART </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> accidentally shot to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by a colleague during an apartment search last year was so concerned about his lack of training that he asked his wife to sue the transit district if anything happened to him, according to a federal lawsuit. Kellie Smith, widow of BART Detective Sgt. Thomas &quot;Tommy&quot; Smith Jr., alleges that BART </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> chiefs routinely sent the transit agency's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> into high-risk searches without the backup of a trained SWAT -- Special Weapons and Tactics -- team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BART's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> leader also denied &quot;training requests by BART detectives and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who were required to do the building ... searches&quot; without the SWAT team, according to a law firm's news release.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Unfortunately, the lack of training ultimately led to Detective Sgt. Smith's tragic </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; said attorney Eustace de Saint Phalle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Not only did Tommy himself foresee and fear this outcome, but this catastrophe could have been easily prevented and his life would have been saved,&quot; Saint Phalle said in the news release.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a letter sent Wednesday to BART directors and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> managers, Kelliee Smith, herself a 20-year BART </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> veteran, said she had tried to confidentially resolve her concerns after her husband's January 2014 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said she had heard only &quot;denials, a refusal to take responsibility, and a refusal to make necessary changes for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> safety and public safety.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BART attorney Dana Fox said Monday that the shooting occurred despite BART's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> having had training that &quot;far exceeded the standards required by (the state Commisison on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police Officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Standards and Training), the governing agency on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> training in California.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While BART has not received the lawsuit, the BART family continues to mourn the loss of Sgt. Smith,&quot; Fox said in an email.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kellie Smith said that she believes </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> know that BART is trying to disband its SWAT team and put more &quot;high-risk tactical assignments on patrol </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and detectives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She also said in her letter that her husband was so concerned about the department's refusal to provide training or send out the SWAT team that he asked her to sue BART and deputy chief Ben Fairow &quot;if anything happens to me.&quot; The complaint, filed Friday, specifically alleges that BART's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> department, under Chief Kenton Rainey and Fairow:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Did not allow the use of trained SWAT </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for &quot;potentially high-risk building and probation searches.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Denied &quot;training requests by BART detectives and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; who had to do building and probation searches without the assistance of BART SWAT.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sgt. Tommy Smith, a San Ramon resident who headed BART's detective division, was assigned to lead a team of eight </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to search the apartment of a robbery suspect on Jan. 14, 2014.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Smith entered one door inside the one-bedroom apartment and emerged from another in shadow, prompting a fellow </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to think he might be an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed suspect</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and shoot him, according to the Alameda County District Attorney's Office report on the killing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The suit asks for an injunction to prevent BART from forcing employees into tactical operations without having the necessary training and to force BART to set training and policies for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and public safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also seeks compensation for Kellie Smith and her young daughter.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">July 01--GOSHEN -- A rash of early morning vehicle thefts occurred in several blocks within the northside neighborhood Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several residents reported items were stolen from their parked and unlocked vehicles in the 300 block of N. Eighth Street and 400 block of Center Street, according to Goshen </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Because of the close proximity and time frame, these thefts are being investigated as one incident and believed to have been committed by the same person(s),&quot; said Tina Kingsbury, administrative assistant with Goshen </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Department. &quot;There is no indication that the victims in these thefts heard any noise during the time of the thefts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 17-year-old teenager reported a theft from her vehicle that occurred at approximately 1 a.m. Sunday while it was parked in the 400 block of Center Street.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Himelda Torres and Omar Aguilar-Dominguez, residents in the 300 block of N. Eighth Street, also reported items missing from their vehicles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hector Padilla told </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> someone entered two of his vehicles, along with Virgelina Esparza, Maria Chavarria and Humberto Chavarria, who reported someone entered their vehicles and nothing was removed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No suspects in these thefts have been determined at this time and the incident remains under investigation,&quot; Kingsbury said. &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> advise residents that thefts from vehicles are usually a crime of opportunity. The would-be thief targets unlocked vehicles. We remind everyone to never leave valuables in your vehicle. If you must leave items in your vehicle, don't leave anything in plain view, and always lock your vehicle.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">May 09--On March 1, 1937, state Highway Patrolman J. Lee Clarke was fatally injured when his motorcycle got caught in streetcar tracks in Reading, causing him to veer into an oncoming coal truck.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The precise cause of most </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officer deaths</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> may have changed since the first half of the last century -- for instance, you no longer hear about motor cops wiping out on trolley tracks -- but the manner of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the majority of line-of-duty fatalities has not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The seed for this column was planted while I was covering the annual memorial service May 1 at the state </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> station on Kenhorst Boulevard in Reading.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the 110-year-history of Reading-based Troop L, 12 members made the ultimate sacrifice, but not necessarily in the way you might expect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although three Troop L members were killed during confrontations with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed suspects,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> six died in motor vehicle accidents and two died in helicopter crashes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One other trooper died accidentally of carbon monoxide poisoning shortly after assisting firefighters extinguish a vehicle fire in which two occupants were trapped in the wreckage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seventy-eight years after Clarke's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">fatal</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> collision with the coal truck, it's still far more likely that an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will be killed by accident than slain by gunfire -- or other methods, for that matter, according to a recent report by the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That may have been expected in 1937, when seat belts and other safety standards were not as advanced as today. But in 2015, it's unacceptable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In March, 50 municipal and state </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> from Berks and Schuylkill counties attended training in Hamburg as part of a national initiative called Below 100.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The goal is to reduce annual line-of-duty </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deaths of officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in all states to fewer than 100.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The last year in which fewer than 100 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> died on duty was 1944. Annual line-of-duty </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deaths</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the U.S. peaked at 278 in 1974 but averaged more than 150 the past 10 years, according to NHTSA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The data indicate that too many </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers' deaths</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are due to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> negligence or carelessness, including speed too fast for conditions, inattention and not wearing seat belts, the report authors said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apparently some, but certainly not all, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> do not practice what they preach.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than three years after two Pasadena </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> fatally shot an unarmed black teenager, a state appeals court heard arguments this week from the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> union, which is trying to block release of an independent report on the killing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Portions of that report released during the legal battle called the slaying &quot;troubling&quot; and said the shooting was preceded by tactical mistakes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For about two hours Wednesday, a three-judge panel from the 2nd District Court of Appeal questioned an attorney for the Pasadena </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police Officers'</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Assn. as well as lawyers representing those who want the report released, including the Los Angeles Times and the teen's mother.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richard Shinee, an attorney for the union, told the justices that the two </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> involved gave voluntary statements to criminal homicide investigators. But, he said, the department used those statements in a subsequent personnel review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The chief of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> relied on those statements to decide if they violated [administrative] policy,&quot; Shinee said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The independent consultant's report, which was conducted for the city, used the private personnel information, so the entire report should be withheld from the public, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report has been kept secret since it was completed last summer. The Pasadena </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> union representing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jeffrey Newlen and Matthew Griffin, who shot and killed Kendrec McDade on March 24, 2012, sued to block the report's release. The union contended the assessment of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers'</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> actions was legally protected personnel information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But during oral argument, the justices questioned the notion that any information collected and put into a personnel file is prohibited from disclosure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice Jeffrey Johnson wondered whether the phone book would get protection if it was put into an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> personnel file. He suggested that under the union's argument, no shooting investigation should be public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presiding Justice Frances Rothschild said it would be a stretch to withhold the entire report, noting that the privacy protection is for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> not an entire department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The appellate case stemmed from a ruling in November when Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge James Chalfant decided that most of the independent consultant's report could be made public, with limited redactions. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> union then filed a petition with the appellate court to stop the release.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kelli Sager, representing The Times, told the justices that only records generated for the specific purpose of appraisal or discipline constitute personnel records and the report was neither. She warned that the department could simply &quot;sweep up everything&quot; into personnel files.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case illustrates the growing divide between </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> unions and the public when it comes to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> accountability. Sager said that given the national climate, the public has more interest than ever in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers'</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> use of deadly force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are talking about a young man shot eight times,&quot; she told the justices about McDade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McDade was being pursued by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Sunset Avenue when Griffin, in a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> car, cut off his path with the vehicle and, seeing McDade's hand at his waistband, shot him, according to prosecutors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Newlen, chasing on foot and believing his partner had come under fire, shot the teenager as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Pasadena </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police Officers'</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Assn. included significant portions of the report in legal papers filed with the appellate court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report by the Office of Independent Review consulting group found Griffin and Newlen made faulty tactical errors, including a lack of communication between the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> their decision to enter a narrow alleyway and put themselves in a vulnerable position, and closing their distance on a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">suspect</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> they believed was </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> based on a false 911 report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They repeatedly made tactical decisions that were not congruent with principles of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> safety,&quot; the report concluded, according to excerpts contained in the union filing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such tactical mistakes by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> putting themselves in a position of danger led to &quot;the eventual perceived need to use deadly force,&quot; the report said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report called certain maneuvers by Griffin &quot;troubling,&quot; and concluded the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> made a &quot;potentially disastrous mistake&quot; when he got out of the patrol car without putting it in park. Newlen separated himself from his partner to chase McDade, even though department policy suggests that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> stay together during foot pursuits, the report stated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were cleared of wrongdoing in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Department's internal review and by the L.A. County district attorney's office. Pasadena paid about $1 million to settle wrongful-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> suits brought by McDade's parents.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two Baltimore </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> say a man attempted to rob a hack driver, and then led them on a chase to an auto garage in Northwest Baltimore and pointed a pistol at them -- prompting them to fire their service weapons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The standoff in the 5200 block of Eleanora Ave. on the morning of June 7 left Keith Davis Jr. hospitalized in critical condition with a gunshot wound to the face, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said. He has been charged with 17 crimes related to the incident, including first-degree assault, attempted armed robbery and multiple gun violations, according to court records.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Davis, 23, of the 11700 block of Stonegate Lane, Columbia, is also charged with discharging a firearm. A </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> description of the events filed in Baltimore District Court makes no mention of his firing the .22-caliber long pistol that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said he brandished.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The records do, however, provide the most detailed account of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-involved shooting to date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Catherine Filippou and Lane Eskins were in the 3900 block of W. Belvedere Ave. about 10 a.m. June 7 to help investigate a car crash when an unlicensed cab driver, or hack, pulled into the accident scene and told the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that his passenger had a gun and was attempting to rob him, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Davis then jumped out of the car and ran, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said. Eskins gave chase.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Davis ran into the auto garage, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said. Eskins and Sgt. Alfredo Santiago said they observed Davis &quot;with gun in hand attempting to gain cover&quot; behind a refrigerator and steel cabinets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Davis then &quot;raised his weapon and pointed it in the direction&quot; of Eskins and Santiago, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said. They said the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ordered him to drop the weapon and raise his hands, &quot;which he refused.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eskins and Santiago then opened fire, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said. Davis &quot;continued to take a position of cover,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said, and more </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were called to the scene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> arriving said they could see that Davis was still pointing his weapon toward the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> they said, and &quot;additional shots were fired.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Davis &quot;then yelled that he would put the gun down and come out if the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would not kill him,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said. He surrendered and &quot;laid on the ground with his hands spread.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> found Davis with a gunshot wound to his face and called for a medic, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said. Davis was taken to Sinai Hospital in critical but stable condition, they said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said they found the long pistol on the top of the refrigerator Davis had used for cover. No </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were injured in the standoff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charles Holden, the hack driver, told </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that Davis got into the front passenger seat and asked to be taken to the Yale Heights Apartments, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the way, Holden told </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Davis &quot;pulled out a handgun,&quot; demanded money and then patted down Holden's front pockets, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said. Then Holden pulled up to the crash scene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eskins, Filippou, Santiago and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Israel Lopez have been placed on administrative duties pending a review of the shooting by the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Department's force investigation team, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said. None of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has been involved in a shooting before, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Davis has been charged with attempted armed robbery, attempted robbery, three counts each of first-degree assault and second-degree assault, four weapons charges, failure to obey </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> theft, and three counts of reckless endangerment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Davis is now being held in jail. He did not have an attorney listed in court records. A trial has been scheduled for July 14.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also on Monday, the Maryland Transit Administration named MTA </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police Officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Aaron Jackson, 28, a three-year veteran of the force, as the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who shot an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed suspect</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the leg in the 5500 block of Harford Road on Friday night after &quot;a struggle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man was taken to Johns Hopkins Hospital for treatment. Baltimore </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are investigating the shooting. Details have not been provided, and the suspect has not been identified or charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson has been assigned to administrative duties pending the investigation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Six Anaheim </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were justified in shooting and killing a suspected armed robber who opened fire on them during a SWAT standoff, Orange County prosecutors have determined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Investigators have cleared </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nick Bennalack, Mark Brydges, Jeff Burke, Douglas Elms, Catalin Panov and Steven Salicos for the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of Steen Thomas Parker, who spent an hour holed up in a vehicle at an auto lot during the standoff Sept. 19, according to a letter to Anaheim </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chief Raul Quezada outlining the results of the district attorney's investigation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Witnesses reported that Parker, 43, was confronted by a security </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at a Fry's electronics store after he and an accomplice tried to steal electronic equipment. Parker reportedly pulled a handgun from a shoulder holster hidden under a blazer and pointed it at the security </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as he fled the store, the D.A. report says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Authorities tracked him to a lot at Manheim Auto Auction in the 1300 block of North Tustin. The department's helicopter, a SWAT team and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> dogs responded to the area, while Parker hid in a BMW parked in the lot. According to D.A. investigators, Parker ignored numerous commands broadcast from the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> helicopter and from a SWAT vehicle, along with direct orders from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> told D.A. investigators that they used a wide variety of non-lethal measures to get Parker out of the BMW, including gas, pepper ball and bean-bag rounds, as well as a rubber baton fired from a launcher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eventually, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> heard a gunshot come from the BMW and suspected that Parker was trying to &quot;bait&quot; the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> into thinking he had committed suicide so that they would come near the BMW. Several minutes later, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> saw Parker moving in the back of the vehicle and once again ordered him to get out, according to the D.A. report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parker appeared to be ready to comply, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> told D.A. investigators, raising his hands to show </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a handgun magazine with at least two cartridges and beginning to move his body. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> believed that Parker was under the influence of a controlled substance, since his movements were &quot;short and choppy,&quot; and he was continually clenching his teeth and jaw.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> told investigators that Parker suddenly dropped his hands, then raised them again quickly, at which point an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> fired a beanbag round, striking Parker in the shoulder. Parker fell to his right, clutched his shoulder and screamed, then pointed a handgun at two </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and began firing in their direction, according to the D.A. report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> returned gunfire, they told investigators, striking Parker numerous times. He was pronounced dead at the scene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A toxicology examination following Parker's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> determined that he had methamphetamine in his system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">D.A. investigators concluded that the half-dozen </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who shot Parker acted in self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Despite numerous commands to surrender and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> use of non-lethal force, Parker continued to brandish a handgun,&quot; the investigators wrote in the D.A. report. &quot;Finally, Parker actually opened fire at the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> from close proximity. It is very hard to imagine a more dangerous set of circumstances to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> than being in close proximity to an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> robbery </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">suspect</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who is pointing his gun at the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and firing at them.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dudley's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> car, a Ford Crown Victoria, crashed into Mansfield's Chevy Cavalier about 12:45 a.m. Dudley said he was rushing to help other </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in pursuit of an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed suspect</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> when the crash occurred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hartford </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> found that Dudley was driving 57 mph on Woodland Street and ran a red light before crashing into the passenger side of Mansfield's car. Dudley told </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> he slowed at the intersection and looked both ways and that the Cavalier then appeared in front of him. He had turned on his lights and siren 100 to 130 feet before the intersection, investigators found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dudley's lawyer, Kevin Smith of New Haven, said the jury began deliberating Friday afternoon and reached its verdict about 11 a.m. Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This was a terrible tragic case and Taikwon certainly feels that way himself,&quot; Smith said. &quot;He is grateful to the jury for their service.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dudley is satisfied with the verdict, but &quot;still remains terribly sorry for this tragic accident,&quot; Smith said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Smith praised the jury for focusing on the evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not a crime every time someone dies,&quot; he said. &quot;A lot of times, for a jury, when someone died, there is a lot of pressure on them to place that blame somewhere.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hartford Deputy </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chief Brian Foley said Dudley has been on an internal assignment as the case has progressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now that the criminal case has been adjudicated, there will be a separate administrative investigation,&quot; Foley said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mansfield's estate has sued the city, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> department and Dudley. The case is pending.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The suspect killed in a shooting with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Monday was armed with a sawed-off shotgun, the Alberta Serious Incident Response Team's executive director said Tuesday. Susan Hughson said the incident began when the suspect was pulled over at 118th Avenue and Abbottsfield Road by two Edmonton </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Service </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who had received a tip about a possible impaired driver at about 9:30 p.m. Monday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The 31-year-old driver and sole occupant of the vehicle became involved in an altercation with the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,&quot; Hughson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The suspect was shot and died at the scene. A </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was also shot and wounded during the incident, but not critically injured. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> remained in hospital Tuesday and was expected to make a full recovery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The suspect's name is not being released, though he was known to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He was not the owner of the car, but Hughson said </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have no reason to believe it was stolen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hughson said an autopsy will be performed Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ASIRT investigators concluded their work at the scene Tuesday morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to reporters at a news conference at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> headquarters about 12:30 a.m. Tuesday, Edmonton </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chief Rod Knecht said &quot;a confrontation&quot; occurred during the traffic stop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was an exchange of gunfire and an EPS member was shot,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the suspect was fatally shot and pronounced dead at the scene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> an eight-year veteran of the Edmonton </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Service, was taken to hospital by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with a wound to his lower body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Knecht described the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as being &quot;heavily sedated, but in good spirits&quot; overnight, surrounded by family and other </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The injured </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> name has not been released. He is described as being in his 40s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Knecht said the other </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> involved in the incident has been a member of EPS for 10 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Nissan Maxima sedan remained parked in one of the westbound lanes of 118th Avenue on Tuesday morning, its driver's side door open. A large section of road and most of a neighbouring park was cordoned off with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tape as investigators worked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could be seen taking photos and measurements around the area. &quot;One of the most dangerous things </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> do is stop cars,&quot; Knecht said during the early morning news conference. &quot;The public probably doesn't appreciate that because they think, 'Well I'm just getting a ticket or whatever else.' But it's really an unknown for us when we stop a car. You don't know who is in the vehicle and what they have been doing or what they plan on doing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hughson said she knows which </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shot the suspect and how many shots were fired, but would not release that information at this time. She said ASIRT has investigated six or seven shootings across Alberta since Christmas. ASIRT investigates incidents involving the province's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that have resulted in serious injury or </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to any person, as well as serious or sensitive allegations of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> misconduct.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Teams of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> wearing riot gear were spotted moving into Oxford University Parks this afternoon, and a forensic tent has been set up in the grounds of the historic site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jed Allen Didcot murders: Live updates as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> launch manhunt</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have warned the public not to approach the 21-year-old, who was revealed on his social media profiles to have a fascination with comic book characters like X-Men's Wolverine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On his Instagram page Allen has numerous pictures of the Marvel character along with a Wolverine 21st birthday cake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one shot he poses with a makeshift version of the character's iconic, razor-sharp claws and in another from 10 months ago, Allen can be seen showing off a hunting-style knife approximately 10 inches long with the caption 'today's purchases'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another picture of the same weapon has the caption 'you call that a knife' a reference to the film Crocodile Dundee.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His social media account shows a keen interest in comic book characters including the violent vigilante The Punisher, and the Spiderman villain Venom.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DUBLIN &gt;&gt; A BART </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> accidentally shot to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by a colleague during an apartment search last year was so concerned about his lack of training that he asked his wife to sue the transit district if anything happened to him, according to a federal lawsuit. Kelli Smith, widow of BART Detective Sergeant Thomas &quot;Tommy&quot; Smith Jr., alleges that BART </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> chiefs routinely sent the transit agency's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> into high-risk searches without the backup of a trained SWAT - Special Weapons and Tactics - team.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BART's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> leader also denied &quot;training requests by BART detectives and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who were required to do the building ... searches&quot; without the SWAT team, according to a law firm's news release.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Unfortunately, the lack of training ultimately led to Detective Sergeant Smith's tragic </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; said attorney Eustace de Saint Phalle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Not only did Tommy himself foresee and fear this outcome, but this catastrophe could have been easily prevented and his life would have been saved,&quot; Saint Phalle said in the news release.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a letter sent Wednesday to BART directors and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> managers, Kellie Smith, herself a 20-year BART </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> veteran, said she had tried to confidentially resolve her concerns after her husband's January 2014 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said she had heard only &quot;denials, a refusal to take responsibility, and a refusal to make necessary changes for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> safety and public safety.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BART's attorney, Dana Fox, said Monday that the shooting occurred despite BART's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> having had training that &quot;far exceeded the standards required by (the state Commisison on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police Officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Standards and Training), the governing agency on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> training in California.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While BART has not received the lawsuit, the BART family continues to mourn the loss of Sgt. Smith,&quot; Fox said in an email.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kelli Smith said that she believes </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> know that BART is trying to disband its SWAT team and put more &quot;high-risk tactical assignments on patrol </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and detectives.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She also said in her letter that her husband was so concerned about the department's refusal to provide training or send out the SWAT team that he asked her to sue BART and Deputy Chief Ben Fairow &quot;if anything happens to me.&quot;. The complaint filed Friday specifically alleges that BART's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> department, under Chief Kenton Rainey and Fairow: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">o Did not allow the use of trained SWAT </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for &quot;potentially high-risk building and probation searches&quot; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">o Denied &quot;training requests by BART detectives and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; who had to do building and probation searches without the assistance of BART SWAT.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tommy Smith, a San Ramon resident who headed BART's detective division, was assigned to lead a team of eight </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to search the apartment of a robbery suspect on Jan. 14, 2014.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Smith entered one door inside the one-bedroom apartment and emerged from another in shadow, prompting a fellow </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to think he might be an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed suspect</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and shoot him, according to the Alameda County District Attorney's Office report on the killing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The suit asks for an injunction to prevent BART from forcing employees into tactical operations without having the necessary training and to force BART to set training and policies for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and public safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also seeks compensation for Kellie Smith and her young daughter.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">June 03--A Mesa County woman suspected of fatally shooting her ex-husband died Wednesday from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head, but not before leading Weld County authorities on an hour-long chase that ended in Brighton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chase began shortly after 10 a.m. when Greeley </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> attempted to contact Barbara Ann Blanton-Marez, 39, of Grand Junction, in the 300 block of 35th Avenue.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Weld County dispatchers received a message from the Mesa County Sheriff's Office through the Colorado Criminal Information Center that Blanton-Marez was thought to be in the Greeley area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, Blanton-Marez was named a person of interest in Monday's suspicious </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of 50-year-old Lawrence Marez in his home in the 2900 block of Globe Willow Avenue in Grand Junction. Blanton-Marez was listed as armed and dangerous and possibly driving a stolen red 2007 Ford pickup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blanton-Marez also was wanted on a warrant for walking away from community corrections May 29, according to the Mesa County Sheriff's Office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She was serving a three-year sentence for a felony menacing conviction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Greeley </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> located Blanton-Marez and the red Ford pickup on 35th Avenue, they attempted to pull her over, but she refused to yield. Instead, Blanton-Marez led </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> north on 35th Avenue to O Street and then east on O to U.S. 85. Blanton-Marez then sped south on the U.S. 85 Bypass toward Brighton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The high-speed chase attracted the participation of the Weld County Sheriff's Office and the Colorado State Patrol, as well as several smaller agencies south of Greeley along the U.S. 85 corridor. Blanton-Marez exceeded speeds of 100 mph and crossed over to the northbound lanes on numerous occasions, said Sgt. Joe Tymkowych, spokesman for Greeley </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police. Officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> attempted to stop Blanton-Marez with tire spikes several times without success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The one-hour chase ultimately came to an end at 11:05 a.m. in Brighton when Blanton-Marez crashed into a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cruiser. It was unknown which agency was involved in the crash and if there were any injuries to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as of Wednesday afternoon, Tymkowych said. The chase contributed to one other crash, which occurred near Evans on U.S. 85. There were no injuries reported in that crash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crash in Brighton immobilized Blanton-Marez's vehicle. She elected to stay inside the pickup as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> from several agencies surrounded her and waited for SWAT to respond to the scene. Greeley </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> used the armored vehicle to approach the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">suspect</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> vehicle. The woman was reported as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and dangerous, and she was seen with a weapon in her hand during the pursuit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While she was surrounded, Blanton-Marez apparently raised a gun to her own head and pulled the trigger, said Greeley </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chief Jerry Garner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Authorities closed U.S. 85 about 10:30 a.m. at Weld County Road 2 because of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> activity. It remained closed much of the day. It was reopened just before 6 p.m., according to the Colorado Department of Transportation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am very proud of the professionalism and restraint shown by our </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> during this dangerous incident,&quot; he said in a news release. &quot;The situation could have ended very badly, and I am so thankful that innocent persons were not harmed by a highly dangerous suspect.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blanton-Marez married Lawrence Marez in March 2014, according to reports by the Grand Junction Daily Sentinel. Mesa County records showed the couple lived in the 2900 block of Globe Willow Avenue. They later divorced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blanton-Marez also was arrested Aug. 6, 2013, by the Grand Junction </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Department when her then-boyfriend reported being stabbed with a kitchen knife multiple times in the back and on his arms after the couple argued for most of the day at their apartment, according to the Sentinel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A witness told the Sentinel a man was being stabbed as he tried to climb out a bedroom window.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time, Blanton-Marez was five months pregnant with the man's child, according to court records.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The District Attorney's Office eventually charged her with second-degree assault causing serious injury, second-degree assault in the heat of passion, menacing and tampering with physical evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A public defender who represented Blanton-Marez described her in court records as &quot;probably having an IQ in the 70-80 range,&quot; while observing it was, &quot;very difficult for her to understand basic criminal justice concepts,&quot; the Sentinel reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mesa County Coroner was conducting an autopsy on Lawrence Marez's body Wednesday. A cause and manner of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had not been released as of Wednesday afternoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Greeley </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Department will conduct an investigation of the vehicle pursuit, Tymkowych said. Colorado State Patrol is investigating the crash in Brighton that brought the chase to an end, and Brighton </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are investigating the shooting. The cause and manner of Blanton-Marez's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will be released at a later date by the Adams County Coroner's Office.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE GOVERNMENT says it has decided to appeal against the judgment in the high court in Pretoria relating to Sudanese President Omar Al-Bashir. The Government Communication and Information System said yesterday the reasons for the appeal would appear in an affidavit that would be submitted within the prescribed due date. This follows the International Criminal Court's call for the government to fulfil its obligations to the Rome Statute by arresting the Sudanese president after the court issued international warrants against him for human rights violations in his country. Earlier this month, Bashir was in South Africa to attend the 25th AU summit in Sandton. He left the country in contradiction of a court order. - sanews.gov.za</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">COLTON &gt;&gt; Officials deemed the non-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">fatal</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shooting of a 14-year-old boy by a Colton </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in 2012 was justified, the San Bernardino County District Attorney s Office announced today.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shortly before midnight on March 20 of that year, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Roberto Dimas fired his weapon four times striking the boy in the foot, officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report said Dimas was dispatched to an apartment complex in the area of San Bernardino Avenue and Sycamore Avenue in Colton for a fight involving five people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Dimas was heading to the location, the call was updated saying the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">suspects</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> fighting were possibly </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with knives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Dimas arrived to his destination he watched the unnamed 14-year-old boy and two adults Christian Palomares, 18, and Jimmy Alcazar, 19, both of Colton get out of a car attacking a person walking on the sidewalk, the statement continued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palomares grabbed the person on the sidewalk and pull a knife out from his pants. Dimas jumped from his patrol car, drew his gun and ordered Palomares to  Stop right there. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With knife in hand Palomares moved toward Dimas causing the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to be in fear of his life, the report continued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dimas fired four rounds toward Palomares only striking the boy in the foot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two other men who were still inside the car later identified as Gonzalo Alcazar, 23, and Manuel Casas, 18, both of Colton were ordered out of the car and onto the ground. Both complied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dimas found two knives on the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One basis for the justification comes from a U.S. Supreme Court ruling, according to the report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That ruling, Tennessee v. Garner, says  Where an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a threat of serious physical harm, either to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or others, it is not constitutionally unreasonable to use deadly force to prevent escape. If a suspect threatens an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with a weapon, deadly force may be used if necessary. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the suspects were taken into custody, Dimas discovered that the boy had been shot in the foot. He was taken to Arrowhead Regional Medical Center in Colton where he was treated for the gunshot wound.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">COLTON &gt;&gt; Officials deemed the non-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">fatal</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shooting of a 14-year-old boy by a Colton </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in 2012 was justified, the San Bernardino County District Attorney s Office announced today.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shortly before midnight on March 20 of that year, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Roberto Dimas fired his weapon four times striking the boy in the foot, officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report said Dimas was dispatched to an apartment complex in the area of San Bernardino Avenue and Sycamore Avenue in Colton for a fight involving five people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Dimas was heading to the location, the call was updated saying the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">suspects</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> fighting were possibly </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with knives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Dimas arrived to his destination he watched the unnamed 14-year-old boy and two adults Christian Palomares, 18, and Jimmy Alcazar, 19, both of Colton get out of a car attacking a person walking on the sidewalk, the statement continued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palomares grabbed the person on the sidewalk and pull a knife out from his pants. Dimas jumped from his patrol car, drew his gun and ordered Palomares to  Stop right there. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With knife in hand Palomares moved toward Dimas causing the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to be in fear of his life, the report continued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dimas fired four rounds toward Palomares only striking the boy in the foot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two other men who were still inside the car later identified as Gonzalo Alcazar, 23, and Manuel Casas, 18, both of Colton were ordered out of the car and onto the ground. Both complied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dimas found two knives on the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One basis for the justification comes from a U.S. Supreme Court ruling, according to the report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That ruling, Tennessee v. Garner, says  Where an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a threat of serious physical harm, either to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or others, it is not constitutionally unreasonable to use deadly force to prevent escape. If a suspect threatens an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with a weapon, deadly force may be used if necessary. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the suspects were taken into custody, Dimas discovered that the boy had been shot in the foot. He was taken to Arrowhead Regional Medical Center in Colton where he was treated for the gunshot wound.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The University of Oxford's parkland was sealed off by armed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> yesterday in their hunt for a man wanted in connection with the murders of a couple and their six-year-old daughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jed Allen, 21, a former university groundsman, is the son of the dead woman, and the killings are being blamed on a domestic incident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> released a photograph of Mr Allen, who has a tattoo of a tarantula covering most of the back of his left hand and a scorpion on the right. His chest has a tattoo of a bear. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> say people should not approach the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">suspect</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who is believed to be </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Janet Jordon, 48, her daughter Derin and Philip Howard, 44, were found dead in Vicarage Road, Didcot, 12 miles south of Oxford, on Saturday night.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Jordon's Facebook page is full of photographs of her family, including one of Mr Allen holding his little sister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detective Superintendent Chris Ward, the head of the Thames Valley </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> major crime unit, said: &quot;The likely cause of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is stab wounds. We are carrying out a number of searches. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Armed officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are assisting. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">suspect</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has a weapon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were called to the redbrick town house at 8.23pm. The victims, who had been living in it for only about two months, were pronounced dead after ambulance staff arrived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oxford University Parks, a 70-acre area of parkland beside the Cherwell, was closed yesterday. Armed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with shields and dogs could be seen on the lawns. A </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> guarded the locked gates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Allen's social media pages indicate that he is a fan of fantasy comics and films. He has at times tried to adopt the look of Wolverine, a character from X-Men, complete with a quiff, bushy sideburns and blades coming out of his hands. His username on the Kik messaging service is WolverTooth. He wrote on Facebook last summer: &quot;Work's turned sour already. Fed up of being treated like dirt. I quoted Batman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has uploaded a picture of himself at work holding an axe, and another of a knife he bought, using the hashtag #crocodiledundee. A gym enthusiast, he has used the nickname Mr Meat Tank. He recently uploaded the quotation: &quot;Once you have accepted your flaws, no one can use them against you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were also searching for Mr Allen in Didcot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Ward said: &quot;The first appeal is to look for a chap called Jed Allen - he is now a suspect. He is ... 6ft tall, he is of large build but, distinctively, he has a tattoo on his left hand of a spider.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is very important we locate him as quickly as possible. I don't believe there is any danger to the wider community. If anyone sees him they should not approach him. Anyone with information about him I am genuinely appealing for them to contact us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> actively looking for him at the moment. We know he has connections with Oxfordshire. We have carried out inquiries last night at addresses he might be. At this stage the families of the victims have been informed and they are being looked after by specialist, trained </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Floral tributes began piling up at the murder scene. A yellow teddy bear was placed inside the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cordon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A handwritten tribute on a bunch of flowers said: &quot;To my best friend, my soul mate, Jan, Dezzy and my anorexic Phil and my gorgeous Jed. You are my family and always will be. I will miss you all each day. You have all left a massive void in my heart which will never be filled.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ST. LOUIS o A third teenager has been charged in the hammer slaying of Bosnian immigrant Zemir Begic in the city's Bevo Mill neighborhood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Juan Carlos Fabian-Lutz, 16, was certified as an adult and charged Tuesday with first-degree murder and armed criminal action.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was ordered jailed in lieu of $1 million cash-only bail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> say that about 1:15 a.m. on Nov. 30, Fabian-Lutz and three other teens exchanged words as Begic, his girlfriend and two other friends walked past them and got in Begic's car parked near Gravois Avenue and Itaska Street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said one of the teens jumped on the back of Begic's car and began hitting it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Begic then got out and exchanged more words with the teens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was attacked and struck with what </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said was more than one hammer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Darrian Johner, 16, of the 3500 block of Minnesota Avenue, was charged in February in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">fatal</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> beating. Robert Mitchell, 17, turned himself in to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> less than 24 hours after the incident and has been charged with first-degree murder and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> criminal action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A fourth </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">suspect</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> identified in court records only as &quot;T.K.&quot; has not been charged in Begic's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Begic was killed amid elevated racial tension in the St. Louis area about a week after a grand jury decided not to indict a white Ferguson </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for fatally shooting a unarmed black teenager. Some claimed that Begic was attacked because he was Bosnian; the suspects are white, black and Hispanic, according to authorities. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said the investigation has not revealed a racial motive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fabian-Lutz lives in the 4100 block of Eichelberger Street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Begic's youngest brother, Rasim Begic, 20, of Waterloo, Iowa, said he and his family are hoping for justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not easy looking at the pictures of the boys who killed my brother,&quot; he said in an email.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I wish it never happened. We as a family miss him a lot. He will live within us forever.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Statistics show that America's racial issues aren't going away</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a report citing the kind of troubling figures that, had they applied to most other countries, might have prompted warnings of necessary foreign intervention, the Washington Post notes at least 385 people &acirc;[#x20ac]&quot; ranging in age from 16 to 83 &acirc;[#x20ac]&quot; have died at the hands of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> across the United States this year. One in six of those </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">victims was unarmed</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, it said, and most were black or Hispanic. And less than 1 per cent of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> involved in the cases were charged with any criminal offence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States is a populous country, so fatality rates in upholding the law are apt to be relatively high. Regardless, a growing number of Americans are alarmed at the statistics piling up this year. The Washington Post reported that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have been directly or indirectly involved in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deaths</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of a daily average of 2.6 people thus far in 2015.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FBI, however, says the figure is actually 1.1 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deaths</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a day, based on statistics over the past decade showing 400 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">fatal police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shootings a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However the fatalities are tallied, the only &quot;good news&quot; is that American democracy prevents such numbers from being swept under the carpet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the contrary, the rising body count is routinely reported, and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> killings of unarmed citizens have sparked demonstrations &acirc;[#x20ac]&quot; and riots &acirc;[#x20ac]&quot; in several towns and cities. Excessive use of force by the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> especially against minorities, has tarnished the American justice system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">High-profile figures have gone on record as saying there is a major flaw and it needs to be addressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time there is growing suspicion that we have yet to understand the true magnitude of the problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African Americans are attempting to address the issue by various means, including a global #124online campaign that carries #124the social-media hashtag &quot;#BlackLivesMatter&quot;. The racist undertones of the killings are clear enough: two-thirds of the unarmed citizens who have died by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hands were either African American or Hispanic, even though it should be noted that the overall count for both </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed and unarmed victims</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is virtually equally divided between Caucasians and minority groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the moment we are left with the troubling spectacle of American diplomats around the world promoting the right to vote, when in their own country citizens are being denied the presumption of innocence unless found guilty in court, a fundamental right of the US Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The world is prepared to admire &quot;the American dream&quot; and appreciates the many benefits and opportunities shared by the US, but we are also seeing a country that has never truly embraced the equality espoused by its founding fathers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">True democracy protects the innocent, regardless of race or creed, and doesn't presume guilt. It ensures that everyone has the same chances in life.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Statistics show that America's racial issues aren't going away</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a report citing the kind of troubling figures that, had they applied to most other countries, might have prompted warnings of necessary foreign intervention, the Washington Post notes at least 385 people &acirc;[#x20ac]&quot; ranging in age from 16 to 83 &acirc;[#x20ac]&quot; have died at the hands of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> across the United States this year. One in six of those </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">victims was unarmed</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, it said, and most were black or Hispanic. And less than 1 per cent of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> involved in the cases were charged with any criminal offence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States is a populous country, so fatality rates in upholding the law are apt to be relatively high. Regardless, a growing number of Americans are alarmed at the statistics piling up this year. The Washington Post reported that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have been directly or indirectly involved in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deaths</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of a daily average of 2.6 people thus far in 2015.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FBI, however, says the figure is actually 1.1 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deaths</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a day, based on statistics over the past decade showing 400 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">fatal police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shootings a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However the fatalities are tallied, the only &quot;good news&quot; is that American democracy prevents such numbers from being swept under the carpet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the contrary, the rising body count is routinely reported, and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> killings of unarmed citizens have sparked demonstrations &acirc;[#x20ac]&quot; and riots &acirc;[#x20ac]&quot; in several towns and cities. Excessive use of force by the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> especially against minorities, has tarnished the American justice system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">High-profile figures have gone on record as saying there is a major flaw and it needs to be addressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time there is growing suspicion that we have yet to understand the true magnitude of the problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African Americans are attempting to address the issue by various means, including a global #124online campaign that carries #124the social-media hashtag &quot;#BlackLivesMatter&quot;. The racist undertones of the killings are clear enough: two-thirds of the unarmed citizens who have died by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hands were either African American or Hispanic, even though it should be noted that the overall count for both </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed and unarmed victims</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is virtually equally divided between Caucasians and minority groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the moment we are left with the troubling spectacle of American diplomats around the world promoting the right to vote, when in their own country citizens are being denied the presumption of innocence unless found guilty in court, a fundamental right of the US Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The world is prepared to admire &quot;the American dream&quot; and appreciates the many benefits and opportunities shared by the US, but we are also seeing a country that has never truly embraced the equality espoused by its founding fathers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">True democracy protects the innocent, regardless of race or creed, and doesn't presume guilt. It ensures that everyone has the same chances in life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The family and friends of the innocents killed by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will care little now for American military or technological might.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The system has let them down in a way that could have been easily avoided had genuine democratic principles been securely in place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cracks in American democracy will hopefully grow no bigger, but attempts to paper them over &acirc;[#x20ac]&quot; for example by diverting public attention to imagined or perceived threats from overseas &acirc;[#x20ac]&quot; threaten the country's future in a far direr manner than any jihadists or military rivals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dissent will only fester and an explosion will be inevitable. Beyond America's borders, its innate hypocrisy is already the subject of disdain and ridicule.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul Woolverton, The Fayetteville Observer, N.C.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7"> BODY:<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">May 19--A former </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> chief who teaches at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York thinks a Fayetteville </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> acted appropriately when he shot and killed Nijza Lamar Hagans in January 2013.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Separately, lawyers for the city of Fayetteville on Monday ended their effort in federal court to keep secret from the public a video of the shooting following its publication last week by The Intercept online news website and other media outlets, including the Observer. The person who leaked the video has not been identified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hagans' father Reggie Hagans has filed a wrongful </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> lawsuit against the city over Nijza's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Aaron Lee Hunt, who is American Indian, shot and killed 22-year-old Nijza Hagans, who is black, during a traffic stop in a residential driveway off South Virginia Avenue of Morganton Road. Hagans had a gun poking out of his pocket, Hunt said afterward, and appeared to reach for it before pushing the car's door into Hunt and jumping out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hunt fired three times at Hagans' front as Hagans came out of the Ford SUV and rushed past him, the video shows. He fired two more times at Hagans' back as Hagans tried to run away. Autopsy evidence appears to show he was hit twice from the front and twice in the back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Once a person is armed ... then he is immediately a threat, and poses a deadly threat to life and limb of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; said Associate Professor John DeCarlo of the Department of Law, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Science and Criminal Justice Administration at John Jay. DeCarlo watched the video of the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Hagans pushed the car door into Hunt and moved out of the car toward Hunt, DeCarlo said, Hunt couldn't know if Hagans intended to shoot him, fight him or run away, &quot;but we know that he has a gun and the outcome couldn't possibly be good. So the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is not required to get shot at in order to take action.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under North Carolina law and federal court rulings, the shots to Hagans back are permissible, DeCarlo said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a shame that anyone has to lose their life over a traffic stop,&quot; he said. &quot;However, the totality of the circumstances clearly say that he remains an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed suspect,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> still able to turn around and shoot you, even though he's running away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DeCarlo is a former chief of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Branford, Conn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lawsuit contends the traffic stop was illegal, conducted as a pretext to search Hagans' vehicle as part of a pattern of racially motivated traffic stops by Fayetteville </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At no time during his encounter with Defendant Hunt did Nijza Lamar Hagans point, hold, brandish, reach for, display, or otherwise use or threaten to use a weapon of any kind,&quot; the suit says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The city was trying to keep the video of the shooting from being made public. State law allows </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> departments to keep from the public videos such as this one, made by camera on the dashboard of Hunt's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cruiser. It says in court papers that in lawsuits such as this, normally it obtains a court order telling plaintiffs' lawyers, such as Billy Richardson and Chuk Umerah in Hagans' case, they must not share the video with anyone. But the city failed to do that this time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the city's lawyers realized this, they requested that the video and other items be returned by Richardson and Umerah. The city followed up with by filing a motion to ask a judge to make Richardson and Umerah give up the materials. In court papers, the city's lawyers contend that Richardson and Umerah were obliged to keep the video and four other items of evidence secret until the judge made a decision on the matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The paperwork also says that Richardson proposed an out-of-court settlement in which the video would be kept secret.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richardson, in papers filed last week, counters that the video and other materials weren't required to be kept secret and the city's lawyers waived their option to keep the video privileged from public dissemination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the publication of the video last week, the city's lawyers conceded that their request is now moot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmie Buxton, head of the Fayetteville branch of the NAACP, viewed the video last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organization has been outspoken in cases in which it thinks </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were wrong in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shootings. But in this case, Buxton said, the organization is withholding comment while the lawsuit is pending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just suggest that anybody that's interested, needs to see the full tape and hear the sound&quot; of when the shots were fired, Buxton said.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> approached the pair, the man, identified later as Sanit Chantana, 39, who appeared to be under the influence of drugs, held out a grenade to threaten them, then hijacked a passing pickup truck and sped off. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pol Sub Lt Sathit radioed other </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to intercept the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed suspect</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanit abandoned the truck in an alley in Makham Tia sub-district after he was shot in the back by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who were pursuing him and went into hiding in a pond in a forested area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 50 policemen surrounded the pond and urged him to surrender. Sanit agreed to come out of the pond after more than an hour. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ordered him to keep his hands in the air and turn around. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The suspect initially kept his hands on his head but then grabbed the grenade from under the water and tried to pull the safety pin when </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> approached. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7"> BODY:<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The city of Minneapolis has reached a nearly $63,000 settlement with a group of former </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> captains who sued Chief Jane&eacute; Harteau, claiming she pushed for their retirement and later reassigned them to inferior positions. After Harteau became chief in 2012, she made clear her intent to enforce the previously negotiated elimination of the captain rank and spoke publicly about her desire for older employees to retire. The captain positions were replaced with five &quot;commander&quot; slots that gave her the ability to appoint whomever she wanted, according to the lawsuit filed in Hennepin County District Court last fall. None of the former captains was selected as a commander, and all were slated for demotion to lieutenant if they did not retire.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2 arrested in carjacking, chase</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> say four suspects kidnapped and threatened a disabled veteran during an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> carjacking that ended with one </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">suspect</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> being shot by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thursday in north Minneapolis. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were called to 21st and Bryant Avenues N. around 4 a.m. on reports of a kidnapping, said spokesman John Elder. Earlier, a resident was reportedly carjacked near 12th and Knox Avenues N. and forced into his vehicle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> spotted the victim's car, and during a foot chase, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> fired and struck one of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">suspects</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who was believed to be </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> authorities said. Two </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">suspects</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were arrested, including the one who was shot, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are searching for the other two assailants.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Autopsy: Drowned woman drunk</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Stillwater woman who disappeared in late April, setting off a search that ended with her body being found May 2 in the St. Croix River, was extremely intoxicated at the time of her </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> authorities said Thursday. Abbey Kae Russell, 24, died from freshwater drowning, and no foul play is suspected, according to the Ramsey County medical examiner's office. Test results showed Russell had a blood alcohol content of 0.336 percent, more than four times the legal limit for driving in Minnesota.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clown player facing sex charges</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 57-year-old man known in Princeton, Minn., as &quot;Friendly&quot; the clown has been charged with sexually assaulting a 20-year-old woman with mental difficulties numerous times. Robert J. Jensen, of Princeton, is scheduled to appear in court next week on three counts of third-degree criminal sexual assault and three counts of fourth-degree criminal sexual conduct. Jensen remains held in the Mille Lacs County jail.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Man gets 5 years for tax evasion</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Twin Cities health care products entrepreneur and longtime tax protester has been sentenced to five years in prison for running up a bill of more than $600,000 in back taxes, interest and penalties. The sentencing of Michael A. Schlegel, 56, of Corcoran, in federal court in Minneapolis last week follows his conviction by a jury on three counts of tax evasion, three counts of failing to file tax returns and conspiracy to defraud the federal government. No restitution was ordered by Judge Patrick Schiltz as part of the sentence, but Schlegel remains liable to the IRS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PAUL WALSH</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ex-cop given longer sentence</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A former Minneapolis </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who lured adolescent girls into sexual encounters via social media was resentenced Thursday in Anoka County District Court after the Minnesota Court of Appeals overturned a previous lighter-than-recommended sentence. Bradley Schnickel, 34, was sentenced to 102 months in prison, taking into account good behavior and time served, meaning he has 32 more months to serve for five felonies that he pleaded guilty to in May 2014. Originally, he was to have been released in June.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A MAN was shot and killed in the Mamelodi West Hostels - allegedly by a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - on Saturday evening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Class Modibe was killed as he was walking along a passage in the hostel while </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were apparently conducting a crime prevention operation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Lungelo Dlamini refuted the claim, saying the incident occurred when an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> man tried to free detained </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">suspects</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> during the operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> confronted him a shoot-out ensued and a bystander was fatally shot,&quot; Dlamini said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, this is in contrast to what hostel dwellers said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They accused the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of lying and claim the shooting was a result of an extortion gone wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zizi Selala said Modibe was shot after a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> failed to solicit a bribe from him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Selala, who regularly plays dice at the hostel, said they were harassed daily by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> came on Saturday I ran away because they had just taken money from me the previous day,&quot; said Selala.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Then they started shooting at me and that's when they shot Class because I was running in his direction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> started shooting randomly at some point because I was already out of his vision,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Selala said it had become a nightmare living at the hostel because of the constant harassment they experienced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> always come here and demand money for one thing or another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you don't give them they arrest you on a bogus charge. I was tired of it and decided I was going to run away this time,&quot; Selala said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chairman of the hostel residents' association Daniel Sello said it was regrettable that a life had been lost at the hands of law enforcers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's always a struggle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Those guys just play their dice and do not bother anyone but the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are always harassing them,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dlamini said </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were investigating a case of murder but no arrests had been made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Independent </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Investigative Directorate (Ipid) has opened a case on the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ipid spokesman Moses Dlamini was not available for comment yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">l In his State of the City Address, mayor Kgosientso Ramokgopa said the city was exploring turning the hostels into bachelor units, rather than family units as had originally been planned because this would be more affordable to those living there who were unemployed or working in the informal sector.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A TATTOOED murder suspect was being hunted in the historic grounds of Oxford University yesterday after his six-year-old sister, his mother and her partner were hacked to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Armed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shut down 70 acres of picturesque parkland as they searched for knife-obsessed Jed Allen, 21.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former college groundsman has an intimate knowledge of the parkland, used by cricket and rugby teams as well as rowing squads.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detectives named him as a suspect after the mutilated bodies of the girl and the couple were found at a house on Saturday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The victims were named as Philip Howard, 44, Jan Jordon, 48, and her daughter Derin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said Allen is related to them but it later became clear he is Ms Jordon's son.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anyone who spots Allen is urged not to approach him but to dial 999 immediately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The stocky six-footer, who often wears a baseball cap, has several tattoos including one of a large, black spider on his left hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detective Superintendent Chris Ward, from Thames Valley </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Major Crime Unit, said: &quot;It is very important that we locate him as quickly as we can.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> closed the 70-acre University Parks, south of the city centre on the banks of the Thames, or Isis as it is called in Oxford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Traumatic Marksmen along with a squad of 20 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with dogs and riot shields moved through the parks yesterday afternoon. Part of the search centred on a pavilion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> appeared to be focusing on the north-east of the parks close to where the River Cherwell flows into the Thames. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> warned passing tourists that the parks would be shut all day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are a large number of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who have been deployed to find the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">suspect</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,&quot; said Mr Ward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Armed police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were drafted in for the safety of the searching </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and there was no suggestion Allen had a gun, he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The alert for Allen was issued after </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> found the bodies of the victims in a house in a quiet street in Didcot, 13 miles south of Oxford, at about 8.20pm on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> went to the property after a call from a neighbour, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Post mortem examinations are due to be carried out today but Mr Ward said: &quot;The likely cause of each of their </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deaths</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is stab wounds.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Allen appears to have a fascination with knives. He posted several photographs of himself on social media wielding various vicious-looking knives and an axe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also posed as the comic superhero Wolverine holding three clawlike blades between the fingers of each hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Allen, who has bushy side burns, seems to have modelled himself on the Wolverine character played by Hugh Jackman in the X-Men series of films.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is understood the couple and Derin moved to the house in Didcot a few months ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before that, they lived for many years in a house just over a mile away, where Allen was regularly seen, according to neighbours. Sheila Welch, a neighbour in Didcot, said yesterday that the couple and child always looked &quot;happy&quot;. Ms Welch said: &quot;They are new neighbours and had only been here a couple of months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I used to see them - a lovely mother and a little girl. They always looked so happy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Describing the scene when </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> turned up on Saturday night, Ms Welch said: &quot;It was about half past eight and there were just sirens and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cars. All I can say is that I am very upset, it is all very traumatic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A neighbour at the couple's former home said: &quot;The little girl was always on her bike with her mum. &quot;She was really nice, she used to smile and say hello when she saw you in the street.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another ex-neighbour told how they moved away suddenly. She said: &quot;One day they were gone. We didn't see any removal van until the new neighbours moved in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several addresses linked to Allen were visited by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forensic experts examined the murder scene. The bodies of the three victims were not moved until about 4.30pm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Toys and flowers were left at the scene. Ms Jordan and Mr Howard had children by previous relationships who were being looked after by specialist, trained </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Ward said: &quot;We offer our condolences to the family. This is obviously a tragic and sad event.&quot; Allen attended the Marlborough School in Woodstock, north of Oxford. He lives in Didcot, according to his Facebook page.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The wounded suspect was rushed into surgery and hospitalized in critical condition following the shooting, which took place about 5:30 a.m. at Valley Boulevard and Mountain View Road , Los Angeles </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lt. John Jenal said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The incident began two hours earlier, when </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> from the LAPD s Southeast Division responded to a report of a domestic assault in the are of 96th Street and Firth Avenue, the lieutenant said. They encountered a victim with significant injuries, but the suspect had already left.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Video: Pursuit and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-involved shooting (Note: Graphic content)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> spotted the suspect driving a white Toyota minivan nearby and began a pursuit when he failed to pull over, Jenal said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The slow speed chase continued for about two hours, primarily on surface streets, Jenal said.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> saw him waving a weapon. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> used a spike strip to flatten the minivans wheels, but the suspect continued driving on the van s rims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He stopped the minivan and exited at Elliot Avenue and Cogswell Road, Jenal said. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> first shot at the man with a bean bag gun before opening fire with bullets, he said. The suspect, who was not struck by the gunfire, returned to the minivan and continued driving.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The minivan again came to a stop, apparently disabled, at Valley Boulevard and Mountain View Road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He put a blanket over him as he exited the van, to the point where you could not see his hands,  Jenal said.  Shortly thereafter, the blanket fell to the ground. In his hand, he brandished that same handgun, that s when the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-involved shooting occurred. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jenal said the suspect suffered multiple gunshot wounds and was in  very critical condition  at an intensive care unit. His identity was not available. He was initially described as about 30 years old.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Graphic video of the incident that emerged online showed the suspect brandishing a handgun in the moments before he was shot. The view of the suspect is obscured at the moment </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> open fire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the minutes leading up, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are seen on the video ordering the suspect to throw his gun out the window, stop his car and surrender.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At one point, the suspect tells </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I don t want to kill myself. I just want to drive.  He later tells an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who orders him to stop his van,  I can t. You don t understand. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EL MONTE &gt;&gt; Los Angeles </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shot and critically wounded an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> domestic violence </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">suspect</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in El Monte early Friday at the conclusion of a two-hour car chase that began in South Los Angeles, authorities said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The wounded suspect was rushed into surgery and hospitalized in critical condition following the shooting, which took place about 5:30 a.m. at Valley Boulevard and Mountain View Road , Los Angeles </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lt. John Jenal said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The incident began two hours earlier, when </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> from the LAPD s Southeast Division responded to a report of a domestic assault in the are of 96th Street and Firth Avenue, the lieutenant said. They encountered a victim with significant injuries, but the suspect had already left.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Video: Pursuit and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-involved shooting (Note: Graphic content)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> spotted the suspect driving a white Toyota minivan nearby and began a pursuit when he failed to pull over, Jenal said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The slow speed chase continued for about two hours, primarily on surface streets, Jenal said.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> saw him waving a weapon. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> used a spike strip to flatten the minivans wheels, but the suspect continued driving on the van s rims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He stopped the minivan and exited at Elliot Avenue and Cogswell Road, Jenal said. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> first shot at the man with a bean bag gun before opening fire with bullets, he said. The suspect, who was not struck by the gunfire, returned to the minivan and continued driving.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The minivan again came to a stop, apparently disabled, at Valley Boulevard and Mountain View Road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He put a blanket over him as he exited the van, to the point where you could not see his hands,  Jenal said.  Shortly thereafter, the blanket fell to the ground. In his hand, he brandished that same handgun, that s when the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-involved shooting occurred. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jenal said the suspect suffered multiple gunshot wounds and was in  very critical condition  at an intensive care unit. His identity was not available. He was initially described as about 30 years old.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Graphic video of the incident that emerged online showed the suspect brandishing a handgun in the moments before he was shot. The view of the suspect is obscured at the moment </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> open fire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the minutes leading up, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are seen on the video ordering the suspect to throw his gun out the window, stop his car and surrender.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At one point, the suspect tells </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I don t want to kill myself. I just want to drive.  He later tells an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who orders him to stop his van,  I can t. You don t understand. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ARMED </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were last night hunting a Wolverine fan with a spider tattoo suspected of butchering three members of his family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detectives warned the public not to approach Jed Allen, 21, who sports bushy sideburns just like the X-Men character and is believed to be </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 6ft-tall </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">suspect</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> vanished after his mum Janet, 48, his stepdad Philip Howard, 44, and his half-sister Derin, six, were found stabbed to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at their home in Didcot, Oxon, at 8.23pm on Saturday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> yesterday sealed off 70 acres of Oxford University parks as they searched for the former groundsman, who has a distinctive spider tattoo on his left hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On his Instagram page Allen has numerous pictures of his Marvel Comics hero, including one showing a Wolverine 21st birthday cake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another snap he poses with knives between his fingers to look just like the character's razor-sharp claws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He shows off a 10in hunting knife in a further pic. It is captioned: &quot;Today's purchases.'' Another photo of the same weapon bears the message: &quot;You call that a knife?&quot; - a reference to a joke from 1986 comedy movie Crocodile Dundee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Allen, who also posed with an axe, appears to have a scorpion tattoo on his right hand and a bear etched on his chest. Det Supt Chris Ward, leading the investigation, said </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were involved in &quot;a number of searches&quot; for Allen. He added: &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Armed officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are assisting with that search. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">suspect</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has a weapon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is very important we locate him as quickly as possible. It is important we find him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> spokesman added: &quot;If you see Jed please do not approach him. Instead call 999 immediately.'' Allen is a former groundsman at Oxford University and is listed online as an apprentice gardener on Didcot Town Council's website.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> launched the manhunt after the three victims' bodies were discovered following a call to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by a member of the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The family had only been living in the house for two months. Neighbour Sheila Welch said that, although she did not know them, they always looked &quot;happy&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She added: &quot;They are new neighbours and had only been here a couple of months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I used to see them, a lovely mother and a little girl. They always looked so happy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All I can say is that I am very upset, it is all very traumatic.'' A former neighbour who lives near the family's old home, also in Didcot, said Janet used to take Derin cycling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said: &quot;The little girl was always on her bike with her mother. She was really nice. She used to smile and say hello when she saw you in the street.'' Last night tributes to the victims began pouring in. One read: &quot;God bless you all xxx Derrin you beautiful angel xx.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wolverine is a fictional superhero who first appeared in Marvel Comics in the 1970s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is a mutant who possesses animal-keen senses and enhanced physical capabilities. He has been depicted as one of the X-Men, Alpha Flight and The Avengers but has featured in his own solo comic since 1988.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The character has appeared in an animated TV series and video games and was played by Australian Hugh Jackman, 46, in the seven X-Men movies.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7"> BODY:<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pakistan, May 4 -- In the past weeks, the Baltimore, US riots have terrorised the city, forcing the Mayor to institute a curfew and to shut down schools and places of work. Civil rights activists, leaders of the Baltimore black community and the family of the deceased have urged protestors to demonstrate peacefully. The riots broke out after Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old black man sustained a spinal cord injury after being arrested by the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for carrying a switch-blade. Gray died on April 19, a week after his arrest, which was proved unlawful because the 'switch-blade' that he was allegedly carrying was actually a pocket knife. Although the Baltimore </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Department refused to admit that excessive force had been used, eyewitnesses stated that Gray's injuries had been inflicted by the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> after they chased him down and arrested him. It was also reported that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> repeatedly refused his pleas for medical care while they were transporting him to jail. On Friday, the Baltimore State Attorney charged the six </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> involved with murder and misconduct charges.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is unfortunate that the rioting has gotten out of control and that several rioters have had to be arrested but it is important to understand that the people of Baltimore are not just protesting the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of Freddie Gray. There have been countless cases of wrongful arrests and shootings of black men (along with other minorities) in the US, yet these have largely gone unspoken and unheard of. Since the Michael Brown shooting last year however, these cases have been increasingly attracting public attention and sparking outrage and protests from people of all races. These reactions show that the attitude towards African-Americans and other minorities has changed drastically in recent history. Yet, there are still strains of racism left, of which </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> departments countrywide are prime examples. There are many security nets in place for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers'</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> misconduct and a system of proper checks needs to be put in place to prevent the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> from misusing their power and exercising caution whilst approaching and arresting suspects. Most of the cases in which </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have used unnecessary force to unlawfully arrest black men seem to have been motivated by fear that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">suspects</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and dangerous based on the way they look. This fear reflects a mindset that African-Americans are more likely to commit crimes. It is regrettable that it took days of rioting for the Baltimore State Attorney to begin investigating Gray's murder. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> union of Baltimore and many legislators are still opposed to the charges that the State's Attorney has brought against the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> involved. There were both black and white </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> amongst those charged with Gray's murder, showing that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of all races tend to racially profile African-Americans. The US </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Departments need to rethink their training procedures to make </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> more racially sensitive and less fearful of African-Americans and hold </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> misconduct to a higher degree of accountability.*</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7"> BODY:<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the past weeks, the Baltimore, US riots have terrorised the city, forcing the Mayor to institute a curfew and to shut down schools and places of work. Civil rights activists, leaders of the Baltimore black community and the family of the deceased have urged protestors to demonstrate peacefully. The riots broke out after Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old black man sustained a spinal cord injury after being arrested by the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for carrying a switch-blade. Gray died on April 19, a week after his arrest, which was proved unlawful because the 'switch-blade' that he was allegedly carrying was actually a pocket knife. Although the Baltimore </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Department refused to admit that excessive force had been used, eyewitnesses stated that Grays injuries had been inflicted by the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> after they chased him down and arrested him. It was also reported that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> repeatedly refused his pleas for medical care while they were transporting him to jail. On Friday, the Baltimore State Attorney charged the six </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> involved with murder and misconduct charges.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is unfortunate that the rioting has gotten out of control and that several rioters have had to be arrested but it is important to understand that the people of Baltimore are not just protesting the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of Freddie Gray. There have been countless cases of wrongful arrests and shootings of black men (along with other minorities) in the US, yet these have largely gone unspoken and unheard of. Since the Michael Brown shooting last year however, these cases have been increasingly attracting public attention and sparking outrage and protests from people of all races. These reactions show that the attitude towards African-Americans and other minorities has changed drastically in recent history. Yet, there are still strains of racism left, of which </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> departments countrywide are prime examples. There are many security nets in place for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> misconduct and a system of proper checks needs to be put in place to prevent the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> from misusing their power and exercising caution whilst approaching and arresting suspects. Most of the cases in which </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have used unnecessary force to unlawfully arrest black men seem to have been motivated by fear that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">suspects</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and dangerous based on the way they look. This fear reflects a mindset that African-Americans are more likely to commit crimes. It is regrettable that it took days of rioting for the Baltimore State Attorney to begin investigating Grays murder. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> union of Baltimore and many legislators are still opposed to the charges that the States Attorney has brought against the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> involved. There were both black and white </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> amongst those charged with Grays murder, showing that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of all races tend to racially profile African-Americans. The US </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Departments need to rethink their training procedures to make </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> more racially sensitive and less fearful of African-Americans and hold </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> misconduct to a higher degree of accountability.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By CHRISTOPHER OJI</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">suspect</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has revealed that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> robbery pays better in Kogi than in Lagos State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Akinropo Ogunsina, 32 and his native doctor accomplice, Jimoh Akeem, are being interrogated at the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) of the Lagos State </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Command.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was working in a Chinese company before I was sacked.&nbsp; I bought a motorcycle for commercial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I also did&nbsp; black market fuel business. I bought fuel from Ijaw oil pipeline vandals. I paid N2,500 for 50 litres and sold for N3,200.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He disclosed that when </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were raiding the business premises daily, he abandoned it and joined an armed robbery gang.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I met Sunday David in Agbara area. Then, I used to sleep in a club at Agbara. He said I should be going out with him to tear nets at night and steal people's phones and monies. We were collecting phones, jewelry, laptops and money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have gone out for operation six times with Sunday.&nbsp; We operated in Egbeda and Agbara. We went out for operation about 12 midnight. I was arrested in 2013, and charged to court. I was released on bail. I don't know how much my friends and family spent to get me out of prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I went to Okene in&nbsp;Lokoja area of Kogi State.&nbsp; One guy, Alhaji, who I used to sell stolen phones, gold and laptops to, directed me to Lokoja. He stays in Agege, Lagos. He directed me to meet one Adeshe and work with him. They operated like those people in Lagos.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I spent only one month there and worked for about three times with him. I had a misunderstanding with him over women. He threatened to deal with me, so I came back to Lagos. I have not done any job since I came back to Lagos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On some of the properties he acquired with&nbsp;robbery money, Akinropo said he bought a Honda car. When he came out of prison for N680,000. It was the little money with my wife, about N90,000 and the job we did in Okene that I put together to buy the car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I got over a million Naira from Okene operation.&nbsp; That is why I said that robbery pays better in Kogi than in Lagos.&nbsp; In Lagos, people don't keep big money at home, but in Kogi, they keep money at home. Moreso, in Lagos, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will be chasing you up and down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was a big man we robbed in Okene. The money was so big that I got&nbsp;over a million naira. We were four in number who went for the operation.&nbsp; I knew Jimoh Akeem in 2010. He disguised as a herbalist.&nbsp; We were operating together when we were tearing nets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We were also deceiving and collecting money from people who came to do medicine for gun protection. He also deceived people that he could&nbsp;change fake dollars for good ones. At-times, he gave me N5,000 after doing the herbalist job and the highest he had given me was N10,000,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the self-acclaimed herbalist, Jimoh, 20, he said: &quot;I am married with two children, I have two wives. I once lived in Ikorodu and later in Iwo. I built a house in Iwo. I have two cars, Murano SUV and KIA Altima.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By LUKMAN OLABIYI</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A&nbsp;suit filed by Mr. Bashir Junaid, a former political associate of National Leader of All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu,&nbsp; seeking fresh investigations into the murder of the governorship aspirant, Funsho Williams, has been struck out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The suit was dismissed on Wednesday by a Federal High Court sitting in Lagos presided over by Justice Rita Ofili-Ajumogobia, following an application based on want of diligent prosecution.&nbsp; The court also awarded N25,000&nbsp; cost&nbsp; against Junaid. He is to pay the money to the Inspector-General of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (IGP) and the Attorney- General of the Federation, who had asked the court to strike out the matter with cost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Williams, an aspirant of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), was on July 27, 2006 strangled to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at his residence, 34A Corporation Drive, Dolphin Estate, Ikoyi, Lagos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Lagos High Court sitting in Igbosere had, on June 30, 2014,&nbsp; discharged six accused persons charged with the murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are Bulama Kolo, Musa Maina, David Cassidy, Tunani Sonani, Mustapha Kayode and Okponwasa Imariebie, who were freed eight years after by retired Justice Ebenezer Adebajo, who held that the prosecution failed to establish a prima facie case against them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Junaid filed the fresh application seeking an order of mandamus compelling the Inspector-General of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to re-open investigations into the assassination, with the hope of possible fresh trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the suit, he had fingered as a prime suspect, Tinubu, against whom the late Williams had been racing for the office of governor before his killing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other defendants were the APC Legal Adviser, Dr. Muiz Banire; Mr. B[#x430]b[#x430]tund[#x435] Edu; Mr. Dele Al[#x430]k[#x435],&nbsp; Mr[#x455].M[#x43e]du[#x440][#x435] Shasore and Ol[#x430]d[#x435]l[#x435] Aj[#x43e]m[#x430]l[#x435], Lagos State APC Chairman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others were the IGP, the Attorney-General of Lagos State and the Lagos Commissioner of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the matter was called on Wednesday, the plaintiff's counsel, Miss O. Benjamin, referring to an earlier order made by the court, said, &quot;My Lord, the matter is for mention today, unfortunately, we've not been able to obtain the order as we were told that the court is ill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Ofili-Ajumogobia, who did not take kindly to the comment,&nbsp;disagreed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BY LUKMAN OLABIYI</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A&nbsp;34- year- old driver and a Beninoise, Innocent Togboe, has been arraigned before a Lagos Magistrate's Court sitting in Igbosere over alleged stealing of N1.65million from his employer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant who has no fixed address, was docked before Magistrate F Dalley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Togboe, who is facing one-count charge of stealing, pleaded not guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prosecutor, Inspector Gbemileke Agoi, told the court that the accused person committed the offence on August 28, 2013 in Victoria Island, Lagos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Agoi said the defendant stole the said sum from Mr Ladi Ajose-Adeogun, his boss.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The defendant stole the money after taking his boss to a gym.&nbsp; While there, the driver searched the car, and took the money&nbsp; from where it was kept, he then dropped the car keys on the seat and fled.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prosecutor said Togboe was later apprehended after his guarantor caught him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After his arrest, Togboe confessed to have committed the crime&nbsp;and had gone to his home country, Benin Republic, built a four-bedroom flat with the money and returned to Lagos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prosecutor said the offence is punishable under Sections 285 (7) of the Criminal Laws of Lagos State of Nigeria 2011.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Magistrate Dalley granted the defendant bail for N50,000 with two sureties in like sum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She adjourned the matter till May 7 for mention.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By CHRISTOPHER OJI</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Esan Renaissance Union (ERU) Edo State chapter, has commended President Goodluck Jonathan for appointing Mr Solomon Arase, one their kinsmen, as the new Acting Inspector-General of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (IGP).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President of the group, Mr Aigbefo Irieteoshe Jnr had at a conference,&nbsp; said the appointment of Mr. Arase was very much in order. In a statement jointly signed by the union president and secretary, Messrs&nbsp; Irieteoshe and Jude.&nbsp; Ihichoya, the union condemned a former IGP, Ibrahim&nbsp; Coomassie&nbsp;for attacking President Goodluck Jonathan over the removal of the former </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> boss, Mr Suleiman Abba, saying the former's statement was not good for democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In as much as others, like former Presidents Olusegun Obasanjo and the late Shehu Umaru Yar'Adua hired and fired other men who were IGPs,&nbsp; Jonathan has the right to appoint and fire IGPs&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The union disclosed that if given the necessary logistics and support by the Federal Government, Arase, by his pedigree would deliver.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similarly, a security analyst, Mr Folorunsho&nbsp;Atta has said Arase's appointment came at a time when the nation needed&nbsp; a transformer for the incoming&nbsp; government of&nbsp; Gen. Muhammadu Buhari.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Arase had always proved that he has what it takes to not only move the force to the next level,&nbsp;but make it the best in Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The wounded suspect was rushed into surgery and hospitalized in critical condition following the shooting, which took place about 5:30 a.m. at Valley Boulevard and Mountain View Road , Los Angeles </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lt.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The incident began two hours earlier, when </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> from the LAPD s Southeast Division responded to a report of a domestic assault in the are of 96th Street and Firth Avenue, the lieutenant said.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> spotted the suspect driving a white Toyota minivan nearby and began a pursuit when he failed to pull over, Jenal said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The minivan again came to a stop, apparently disabled, at Valley Boulevard and Mountain View Road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He put a blanket over him as he exited the van, to the point where you could not see his hands,  Jenal said.  Shortly thereafter, the blanket fell to the ground.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lt. Brad Shannon anticipates members of the Dubuque </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Department's tactical team will receive more calls than usual in the months leading up to the U.S. presidential election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shannon, who is taking over as head of the tactical entry team, said the team's duties include assisting Secret Service when dignitaries - primarily political candidates or sitting presidents and vice presidents - make stops in Dubuque.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With a presidential election, we can get called a lot,&quot; Shannon said. &quot;We assist with whatever they require.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shannon and other entry team members recently completed their 10-hour monthly training at the law enforcement shooting range north of Dubuque. A key component of that training involves marksmanship, though members also practice entry approaches, clearing buildings and other scenarios.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Entry team</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Dubuque </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Department's tactical team actually is comprised of three different teams, according to Assistant </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chief Terry Tobin. Along with the entry team, the department also has </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> trained for the rifle/observer team and the negotiation team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The entry team has 12 members overseen by a lieutenant and a captain, and the rifle/observer and negotiation teams each have six members overseen by a lieutenant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tobin said the tactical entry team is primarily called for serving arrest and search warrants when the people involved are considered dangerous. Tobin said team members also are trained to search for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed suspects</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who have fled into wooded areas. There also are three paramedic firefighters that can accompany the entry team to calls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2012, the entry and rifle/observer teams assisted with visits from President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tobin said the presidential candidates generally do not receive Secret Service details unless they are a nominated candidate or there are threats against them early in the campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When Obama first ran, he got Secret Service right away because of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> threats,&quot; Tobin said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Should a dignitary be targeted in an attack, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> department's teams would immediately stage in that area and handle the threat while Secret Service rushes the politician away from that area, Tobin said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rifle/observer team</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tobin said the rifle/observer team also completes about 10 hours of training per month and can function as snipers. But the team's primary use is to gather intelligence during investigations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're also responsible for pre-raid surveillance and observation of the target area to get us intelligence before </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> move in,&quot; Tobin said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Department records show the entry and rifle/observer teams responded to the same nine calls in 2014, most of which were for search warrants for guns or narcotics. The two teams have assisted on one search warrant so far in 2015, and the entry team and negotiators assisted U.S. Marshals in arresting a federal fugitive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Negotiation team</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tobin said the negotiation team does not have set monthly training, though members will attend out-of-town training sessions when feasible and will meet every few months to talk about recent incidents and review procedures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members of the negotiation team will respond for people who have barricaded themselves or have taken hostages with the threat to harm themselves or others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Department statistics show the team was called out once in 2012 for an arrest warrant with a dangerous person, as well as once in 2013 to assist in arresting an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> domestic-assault </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">suspect</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Continuous training</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because the teams often work in tandem, they will also have full group training at least once per year, Tobin said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That generally will be scenario- type training that they'll work through,&quot; Tobin said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tobin said because the teams are not regularly needed, team members also work in other areas of the department, including as patrol </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> criminal investigation </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and school resource </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shannon, who has been on the tactical entry team for almost 10 years, said a key component of monthly training is repetition of different shooting positions, both to keep marksmanship sharp and to ingrain the movements in each </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> mind. &quot;We want it to be muscle memory,&quot; Shannon said. &quot;They need to know how to react.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tobin said some citizens might not realize the department has a tactical response team, which actually is the point. Tobin said the teams are designed to use the element of surprise and to move quickly and quietly to get the job done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't always use the full complement of teams either,&quot; Tobin said. &quot;When we deploy the teams, we want to draw the least amount of attention possible. We try to be low-key.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Class Modiba died while walking down a passage in the hostel when </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were conducting a crime prevention operation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was in contrast to what witnesses claimed; that Modiba was killed by a rogue </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who was extorting money from gamblers in the hostel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Modiba's brother, Jack, said very little had been done regarding the investigations as witnesses were afraid to come forward with information regarding the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People are scared to come forward with information about what happened. The investigating </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said witnesses were reluctant to give statements, because they were scared that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who shot Modiba might come back for them since he had not been arrested,&quot; said Jack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Modiba, who was a resident at the hostel, was described as a peaceful man by his brother. He was shot and killed on Saturday, May 23. Witnesses said he was hit by a stray bullet fired by a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zizi Selala, one of the witnesses, said at the time that Modiba was shot after a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> attempted and failed to solicit a bribe from him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Selala alleged the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> harassed them daily and arrested them unlawfully.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Selala said after they refused to give the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a bribe, an argument ensued and the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> pulled out his gun and fired randomly. One of the bullets, Selala alleged, hit Modiba and killed him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Lungile Dlamini refuted the claim, saying the shooting occurred when an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> man attempted to free </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">suspects</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who had been arrested during the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said a case of murder was being investigated, but no arrests had been made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Modiba said the family opened a case with the Independent </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Investigative Directorate (Ipid) but no arrests had been made.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Five suspected militants were killed in an alleged encounter when they attacked the convoy of the former Malir senior superintendent of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Saturday evening in the same area where a deputy superintendent of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> along with his guard and driver was gunned down a day earlier.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Malir-SSP Rao Anwar Ahmed Khan told Dawn that he was going to examine the crime scene in Gulshan-i-Hadeed where Bin Qasim DSP Abdul Fatah Sangri was killed on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that due to lack of proper security, he had not visited the crime scene on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said armed men riding three motorbikes and travelling in a car lobbed a hand grenade and opened fire on his vehicle when his convoy was on the link road between the National Highway and the Superhighway. He said he and other officials travelling in the armoured personnel carrier of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> remained unhurt. In retaliatory fire opened by his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> guards, the car driver was killed on the spot, he said. As the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">suspects</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tried to flee, his guards </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with G-3 rifles took positions and killed four of them, while an equal number of suspects managed to escape, the SSP said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rao Anwar claimed to have seized the car, one motorcycle, weapons and hand grenades from their custody.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said the identity of the suspects, who sported beards, could not be ascertained immediately though the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said he believed they were militants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SSP said the dead men could have links with the banned militant outfits as he said he had been facing threat from the Al-Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS) and different groups of the outlawed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan such as the Shaharyar group and the Sajna group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was transferred on Thursday night following his press conference in which the Muttahida Qaumi Movement was accused of its involvement in terrorist activities. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> chief removed him from the position on the charge of misusing his authority, after Chief Minister Syed Qaim Ali Shah had taken serious notice of the press conference and sought a report from the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> chief on the matter within 24 hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Karachi-East DIG Munir Ahmed Shaikh told Dawn that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> investigators found some leads to the targeted killing of DSP Bin Qasim Fatah Sangri, head constable Nazeer Ahmed and constable Farooq Ahmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said sketches of the assailants had been prepared with the help of witnesses. The investigators also had obtained footage to examine and identify the attackers who must have done a recce before targeting the DSP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The senior </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> recalled that in 2001 nine policemen had been gunned down in the same area of Gulshan-i-Hadeed. He said the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> investigators were trying to ascertain if the Friday morning attack had any links with that incident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In reply to a question, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in their initial findings suspected involvement of banned militant outfits in the killing of the DSP, his guard and driver.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;DSP Sangri may not have taken active part against the militants, but he might have been targeted for being a senior </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officer,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; said the DIG East.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SAN JOSE - An annual celebration today for emergency medical services partners at Regional Medical Center of San Jose included a special ceremony for fallen </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Michael Johnson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Japanese maple tree was dedicated to Johnson outside of Regional Medical Center's emergency room, hospital spokeswoman Bev Mikalonis said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnson was shot and killed by an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed suspect</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> while responding to a call for service on March 24. He was a San Jose </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for 14 years and the 12th </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> killed in the line of duty since the department was founded in 1849.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hospital president and CEO Michael Johnson, who has no relation to the fallen </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> led the dedication and unveiled a bronze plaque placed on a rock in front of the tree.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaque reads, &quot;We are forever grateful for the sacrifice you have made to protect and serve our community. To honor the life, strength, and bravery of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johnson, this tree is planted in his memory.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His mother, Katherine Decker, and wife, Nicole Johnson, attended the ceremony, where they were presented with a duplicate plaque, Mikalonis said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The celebration at Regional Medical Center was held in appreciation of the hospital's ONE TEAM, which Johnson was a part of as a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Mikalonis said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A man suspected of assaulting a woman in South Los Angeles was shot by LAPD </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> after a two-hour pursuit that ended in El Monte.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The suspect, whose name has not been released, was wounded during the second of two shootings that happened in the San Gabriel Valley city. LAPD </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Matt Ludwig said the man had a gun.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ludwig said two </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> responded about 1 a.m. Friday to a domestic violence call in the 9300 block of Firth Boulevard. The two </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were speaking with the female victim when they noticed the male suspect driving away in a white Toyota minivan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They attempted to do a traffic stop, but he did not stop and a pursuit started,&quot; Ludwig said. The chase was at low speeds, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At some point during the pursuit, he called CHP and notified them that he was </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; Ludwig said of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">suspect</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once in El Monte, the man stopped the minivan at Cogwell Road and Elliot Avenue and got out. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> opened fire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAPD Lt. John Jenal said it was unclear what exactly happened during that shooting, but he said there was no initial evidence to suggest that the man had been struck. The suspect got back into his vehicle and drove off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ludwig said </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> used a spike strip to disable and stop the minivan, but the man continued driving with flat tires. The minivan came to a stop about half a mile away from the scene of the first shooting, at Mountain View Road and Valley Boulevard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man got out of the vehicle holding a blanket. He dropped it at one point and brandished a gun, according to Jenal and Ludwig. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> fired again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The suspect was taken to a hospital, where he remains in critical condition, Ludwig said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jenal called the incident &quot;very complex&quot; and said the investigations into both </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-involved shootings -- routine after such incidents -- were in their preliminary stages. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said no </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were injured.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jose Luis Arreola Rodriguez, who had been a bodyguard to then Ju&aacute;rez </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> chief Julian Leyzaola Perez, is accused of taking part in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deaths</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of three young men and a woman found April 24, 2012 near the San Rafael cemetery in the outskirts of Ju&aacute;rez, officials said in a news release.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arreola faces four homicide charges and an attempted murder charge as part of an investigation that officials said could lead to more arrests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The arrest comes three days after Leyzaola, who was wounded in a May 8 shooting in Ju&aacute;rez, told the Zeta newspaper in Tijuana that a gunman told him before pulling the trigger that the shooting was a &quot;message&quot; from current </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> chief Jesus Antonio Reyes, who has denied the allegations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Chihuahua attorney general's office said that Arreola's arrest follows a recommendation made last month by the National Commission on Human Rights asking for an investigation into Leyzaola and the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State prosecutors identified those killed in 2012 as Alejandro Martinez Rodriguez, 16, Jesus Efrain Rodriguez Gavirio, 17, Jose Juan Villanueva Leal, 18, and Veronica Cerros Olivas, 22. Prosecutors said a woman survived by pretending to be dead after being wounded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The survivor told investigators that the group was detained by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at a park and were beaten because one of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">suspects</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was allegedly </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> officials said. After being driven around, they were taken to dirt road near the cemetery and made to kneel with their heads covered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The survivor told investigators she heard one of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> say &quot;shoot each one three times in the head&quot; but she was not shot because she pretended to be dead, officials said. The woman later walked through the desert and got help at the customs checkpoint on the Panamerican Highway.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monterey &gt;&gt; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are on the hunt for a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">suspect</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> considered to be </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and dangerous after a male transient was stabbed to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> late Thursday behind the Monterey Public Library.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unidentified 40-year-old was getting ready to go to sleep in an outdoor quad area behind the library when an altercation ensued, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said. A 22-year-old male transient was also stabbed during the fight but survived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> identified Jesse Quiming, 32, as the sole suspect in the double-stabbing. Quiming is not in custody and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> say he is considered armed and dangerous. They are asking that citizens do not approach him, but instead to call 911 if seen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Quiming was identified as the suspect following statements from witnesses, including the younger victim, and further investigation of the crime scene, Monterey </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lt. Marty Hart said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just before midnight, a resident near the library flagged down an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to report a &quot;disturbance&quot; behind the library. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> arrived within minutes and found the 40-year-old unconscious and not breathing. The 22-year-old sustained non-life-threatening injuries and was talking to paramedics on his way to Natividad Medical Center. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monterey Fire Division Chief Stewart Rothe said the 22-year-old's hands were also injured. The victim said the cuts were a result of him trying to defend himself from the attacker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A motive for the double-stabbing is not yet known, and a weapon has not been recovered, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The library was closed for about six hours on Friday as the quad area was cleaned up and investigators collected more evidence from the scene. Droplets of blood were splattered in an area of the library that is usually safe and welcoming, said library director Bill Michael.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is our home,&quot; Michael said. &quot;(Transients) are part of our community, they are human beings. People may get in an argument, but never violence.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael said transients frequent the library just as much as kids and adults, adding that the library &quot;serves everyone.&quot; He said he wants to assure the community that despite the &quot;tragic&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> late Thursday, the library, which closes at 8 p.m. at the latest and is located directly in front of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and fire departments, is a &quot;very safe place to visit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Quiming, who has a criminal record on the Monterey Peninsula, is a transient who frequents the Monterey area. Although he remains at large, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> believe he remains nearby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the third homicide in Monterey this year. The two previous killings were also stabbing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deaths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anyone with information about the incident is asked to call Detective Bryan Kurse at 646-3812.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> then pulls Roof - who had been on the run for 14 hours - out of the vehicle before he is frisked. Despite being the centre of a huge </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> manhunt both the cops and Roof seem remarkably relaxed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eventually Roof is placed in a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> car before a group of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> show their relief by high-fiving each other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has since emerged that Roof was given a Burger King meal by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> after his arrest.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> chief whose </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> arrested Roof has revealed cops bought him a Burger King meal after he said he hadn't eaten since carrying out the assault.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jeff Ledford said the killer refused to answer any question put to him by his staff and that the only conversation he had was about food.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ledford said </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> bought him food from a nearby Burger King. &quot;He was very quiet, very calm. He didn't talk,&quot; Ledford said. &quot;He sat down here very quietly. He was not problematic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roof had been found with .45-calibre handgun in his car and told armed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I am Dylann Roof&quot; when he was arrested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is reported to have shown no remorse and expressed racist views as he later confessed to the crime to the FBI.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The gunman has since been charged with nine counts of murder and possession of a firearm in the commission of of violent crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If found guilty prosecutors as well as South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley have said they will seek the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> penalty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It comes as the relatives Roof's victim told him during his first court appearance on Friday they forgave him for the killings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many have said they would not want him sent to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> chamber.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roof is currently being held in solitary confinement, where he is under 24-hour watch and only allowed out of his cell for 60 minutes a day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As yet he has had no visits from his family or friends with the only person who has talked to him has being his lawyer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His cell is next to the one holding former cop Michael Slager - the policeman accused of gunning down unarmed black man Walter Scott in April.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Victim's family member forgives Dylann Roof at emotional first court hearing</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Friday claimed to have arrested three suspects outside the Defence residence of former home minister Dr Zulfikar Mirza and booked them for possessing illegal weapons, storming the Darakhshan </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> station and harassing policemen when the disgruntled PPP leader went there to record his statement.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SSP-Central Chaudhry Asad Ali, who has been given the additional responsibility of SSP-South, claimed that a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> patrol arrested the three suspects Naik Mohammed, Sikander Ali Brohi and Mohammed Ibrahim and seized as many unlicensed sub-machine guns from them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said a case was registered against the suspects at the Darakhshan </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> station and during initial investigation they &quot;disclosed that Dr Mirza provided them [the seized] weapons&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SSP said that suspect Ibrahim was allegedly associated with the Lyari gang warfare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Talking to Dawn, Darakhshan SHO Abdul Moid said that the former home minister would also be questioned in the light of the disclosures of the held suspects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier, several </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> vans besieged the residence of the former home minister and detained three of his supporters outside his house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mirza planning to go abroad on 30th</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later, Dr Mirza told reporters at his residence that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had detained his guard, driver and a servant. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had staged a drama outside his home by deploying over 20 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> mobile vans including armoured personnel carriers, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He alleged that a conspiracy had been hatched to kill him in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> custody and for this purpose, the task had been given to a senior </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who would administer him a lethal injection once he was inside an APC, which might cause his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that the special security unit (SSU) of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was created to fight terrorism during his tenure as the home minister but now it had been reduced to providing security to VIPs, their families and friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an apparent reference to the alleged removal of SSP-South Tariq Dharejo and some other </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> officials, Dr Mirza said that honest </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had been removed because they refused to arrest him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He launched personal attacks on the chief minister of Sindh and the newly appointed home minister and said he had got bail in all cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He proposed if </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had any new case against him, the DIG and the SSP-South should come to him with an arrest warrant and he would surrender to them like any &quot;law-abiding citizen&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Otherwise, he warned the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could not arrest him through &quot;high-handed tactics&quot; as he had 30-40 guards loyal to him who were willing to sacrifice their lives to save his.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He hoped the judiciary would provide him justice and disclosed that he was planning to leave the country on May 30 for the treatment of his wife, former speaker of the National Assembly Dr Fahmida Mirza, and said he would inform the media before departure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that he would visit the shrines of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Shahnawaz Bhutto, Mir Murtaza Bhutto and Benazir Bhutto after returning from abroad and would wage jihad by launching a mass awareness campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to a question, he hinted at contesting next general election from PPPs platform provided Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari assumed leadership of the party.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MISHAWAKA -- </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> found two toddlers wandering a Mishawaka street Friday morning near the place where their mother was shot and killed during an apparent domestic dispute moments earlier.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lt. David Wells, assistant commander of the St. Joseph County Metro Homicide Unit, said </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> responded late Friday morning to the 1200 block of Sixth Street, just east of Logan Street, after they received a 911 call about a reported shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There, they found a woman, later identified as 22-year-old Precious Jackson, lying in the street with a gunshot wound. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> named 18-year-old Tyron Devon Johnson as the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">suspect</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnson, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with a semi-automatic handgun, ran north from the scene, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were trying to track him with dogs Friday afternoon. They said Johnson should be considered armed and dangerous, and anyone who sees him should immediately call </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson and Johnson also had a 1-month-old baby together. The two toddlers were found standing in the street. All three children were taken into custody. The Department of Child Services will be in charge of their placement, Wells said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wayne Zimmer who lives near the intersection of Sixth Street and Cleveland, said Jackson and Johnson were walking down the street, toward Johnson's mother's house, moments before the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmer said the pair had just gotten off the Eighth Street bus and were walking in the rain with the children in tow. He said he came outside when he heard them arguing and watched as they continued down the street. He went back inside when he lost sight of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's when Zimmer heard several gunshots ring out. He said he ran outside and saw Jackson lying in the street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> swarmed the scene, two women consoled another woman who was wailing and sobbing, and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had McDonald's Happy Meals delivered to the scene to feed children who were stranded inside the crime scene while their parents waited outside the yellow tape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> guarding the crime scene turned away a man who said he was Jackson's brother. The man angrily shouted that the suspect ran to a local apartment complex, and demanded that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> go to the complex and arrest &quot;any (expletive) you find.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If officially ruled a homicide, the shooting would be Mishawaka's first killing of 2015, but it would make the 10th killing recorded in St. Joseph County this year, according to Tribune archives, and the second </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">fatal</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shooting this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are also still looking for 18-year-old Marqwan Beserra, who is suspected in a shooting that left 21-year-old Jerry Wright dead Tuesday evening in the 2400 block of West Frederickson Street in South Bend.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Jucrez </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was arrested Monday in connection with the execution-style shooting of four people three years ago, the Chihuahua state attorney general's office said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jose Luis Arreola Rodriguez, who had been a bodyguard to then Jucrez </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> chief Julian Leyzaola Perez, is accused of taking part in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deaths</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of three young men and a woman found April 24, 2012 near the San Rafael cemetery in the outskirts of Jucrez, officials said in a news release.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arreola faces four homicide charges and an attempted murder charge as part of an investigation that officials said could lead to more arrests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The arrest comes three days after Leyzaola, who was wounded in a May 8 shooting in Jucrez, told the Zeta newspaper in Tijuana that a gunman told him before pulling the trigger that the shooting was a &quot;message&quot; from current </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> chief Jesus Antonio Reyes, who has denied the allegations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Chihuahua attorney general's office said that Arreola's arrest follows a recommendation made last month by the National Commission on Human Rights asking for an investigation into Leyzaola and the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State prosecutors identified those killed in 2012 as Alejandro Martinez Rodriguez, 16, Jesus Efrain Rodriguez Gavirio, 17, Jose Juan Villanueva Leal, 18, and Veronica Cerros Olivas, 22. Prosecutors said a woman survived by pretending to be dead after being wounded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The survivor told investigators that the group was detained by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at a park and were beaten because one of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">suspects</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was allegedly </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> officials said. After being driven around, they were taken to dirt road near the cemetery and made to kneel with their heads covered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The survivor told investigators she heard one of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> say &quot;shoot each one three times in the head&quot; but she was not shot because she pretended to be dead, officials said. The woman later walked through the desert and got help at the customs checkpoint on the Panamerican Highway.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A DRAMATIC chase to apprehend two </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> robbery </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">suspects</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ended in tragedy yesterday when a &quot;good Samaritan&quot; was gunned down in one of Port Elizabeth's busiest streets.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Deon Niemand, 43, was fatally shot in the chest while trying to stop two robbery suspects in their tracks at about 2.10pm. <BR> Niemand died in the middle of the four-lane Uitenhage Road in Sydenham where he had been in a scuffle with the men, one of whom shot him before fleeing. <BR> Niemand, who was yesterday hailed as a hero and a good Samaritan, had managed to recover the stolen property which, unbeknown to the suspects, consisted of a virtually empty laptop bag and a few rands in cash. <BR> The drama started just minutes before in Commercial Road, an extension of Uitenhage Road, when a self-employed western suburbs man, George Carr, 45, had finished conducting his business at Don's Pawn shop there.<BR> After leaving the shop with his laptop bag, Carr was about to get into his vehicle when he was approached by two men, one of who attempted to grab his bag. <BR> A shaken Carr said he had hung onto his bag until one of the suspects produced a handgun and thrust it into his face. &quot;Then I just let go and hit the floor. <BR> &quot;The two guys started running down the road with my bag and then jumped over a railing to get onto Uitenhage Road,&quot; Carr said. <BR> There was not much in the bag as he had already made a large payment inside the store.<BR> Carr said he jumped into his car and proceeded to chase the two men through oncoming traffic down Commercial Road and into Uitenhage Road. <BR> Two men in a black Volkswagen Golf, who had also been at the shop, also gave chase.<BR> &quot;When I got into Uitenhage Road, I saw the two guys. I saw some other people in a scuffle with them. I heard a shot go off. <BR> &quot;It turns out that this poor man [Niemand] was driving past and saw the guys running with the bag. He jumped out to help catch them and was shot just like that. <BR> &quot;He is a bloody hero, this guy. I am so, so very sorry that he has died. I am still shaking inside.&quot; <BR> Port Elizabeth </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> spokesman Warrant </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Alwin Labans said one of the two suspects, 25, was arrested at the scene.<BR> He said the second suspect, who is believed to have fired the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">fatal</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shot, was known to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and they expected to arrest him soon. Labans said an armed robbery and a murder docket had been opened. <BR> According to a friend of Niemand's, Morne Lottering, 20, who was at the scene, Niemand lived and worked at the nearby Propshaft Centre.<BR>  He said he was &quot;a great guy&quot; who had spent the last few years successfully getting his life back on track after difficult times.<BR> Propshaft Centre owner Jan Serfontein last night echoed Lottering's sentiments and described Niemand as a person who was always happy and willing to help at any time.<BR> ROBBED: GEORGE CARR</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A two-month manhunt for a former LAPD </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> accused of murder ended Tuesday when the 27-year-old was arrested in Mexico, authorities said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chihuahua state authorities said Henry Solis resisted arrest, but no shots were fired when he was apprehended in Juarez, across the Rio Grande from El Paso.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Solis told authorities he knew his capture was coming &quot;sooner or later,&quot; Mexican officials said at a news conference.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One state </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> official said Solis was &quot;hidden among relatives&quot; in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">El Mezquital neighborhood where he was arrested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The official, Pablo Ernesto Rocha Acosta, didn't give specifics about what led investigators to the neighborhood, saying only that Solis' capture was the result of technology, field work and the exchange of information with United States authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Solis was deported to the U.S. on Tuesday evening and will be held in federal custody in El Paso, according to FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Solis had been the target of an international manhunt after a warrant was issued for his arrest, alleging that he shot and killed Salome Rodriguez Jr. in downtown Pomona while off-duty during the early morning hours of March 13.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the days that followed, Solis was fired from the Los Angeles </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Department and his father charged with lying to federal investigators about his son's whereabouts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, Rodriguez's mother welcomed the news of Solis' arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lidia Rodriguez said she had kept a nightly vigil in the parking lot where her wounded son collapsed, praying federal agents would find the man accused of killing him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If it's true he got caught, hallelujah!&quot; she said. &quot;We think this is God's work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Solis, a former Marine who served a tour in combat in Iraq had spent nine months with the LAPD before authorities allege that he became involved in some kind of dispute with Rodriguez at a Pomona bar, then chased him and shot him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coroner's officials said Rodriguez, a 23-year-old truck driver, was shot four times.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Victor Solis left his Lancaster home the morning of March 13 and drove with his son 800 miles to El Paso, where he told authorities he dropped the younger Solis off at a bus stop, according to court records.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But surveillance footage showed Victor Solis walking with his son across the border into Mexico, authorities said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The father was later arrested and charged with lying to federal investigators in an attempt to help hide his son.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, a federal judge released Victor Solis on $10,000 bail.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LOCKPORT - A Niagara Falls man is scheduled for an extradition hearing July 7 after being indicted on a murder charge in Los Angeles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kevin W. Jones, 48, appeared before Niagara County Judge Matthew J. Murphy III Tuesday and asked for a hearing rather than conceding he is the wanted man. He is charged with a homicide that occurred March 23.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Assistant District Attorney John P. Granchelli said Jones was arrested by Niagara Falls </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> May 1 on a bail-jumping charge, connected to a 2011 criminal mischief arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Buffalo News reported that on Dec. 9, 2011, Jones was charged with third-degree criminal mischief, resisting arrest and obstructing governmental administration after he allegedly threw a small dresser through the front window of his mother's house on LaSalle Avenue after barricading himself inside; he was intoxicated at the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked where Jones was between then and May 1 of this year, Assistant Public Defender Michael E. Benedict said he wouldn't answer that question at this time. The bail-jumping charge is due to be presented to a local grand jury while the criminal mischief case is pending in Niagara Falls City Court, with the next appearance scheduled for July 15. Jones is being held without bail in Niagara County Jail.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> pulled up to the window just after midnight Tuesday in the 2400 block of Pine Avenue and was informed by a clerk that the passenger in the car in front of them had a bag full of marijuana in his lap.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> caught up to the car and pulled the driver over for not wearing a seatbelt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A search of the vehicle found a backpack with a digital scale disguised as a cellphone, marijuana, multiple narcotic pills and wrapped baggies containing heroin. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The passenger, Maurice E. Betton, 21, of 22nd Street, was charged with fifth-degree criminal possession of a controlled substance and use of drug paraphernalia.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The victim said the intruder tried to choke him and then put the gun to his head, demanding money and his cellphone. He handed over $400 in cash and a $300 cellphone. He said the suspect hit him in the head multiple times with the handgun, then jumped out of the window and fled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The victim said he was able to find someone to drive him to Niagara Falls Memorial Medical Center, where he was treated for cuts and swelling and then released. The victim told </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> he believes the man may have stacked garbage cans to climb into the window and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> found three garbage cans underneath the window with blood on the siding, as well as a large amount of blood in the bedroom.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">May 16--Victoria </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> deployed their SWAT team members and an armored protection vehicle Friday morning to arrest three men suspected in a string of crimes involving home invasions, controlled substances, theft and the possession of stolen property.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The heavy equipment along with the smoke distraction devices attracted the attention of several neighbors as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> converged on a home at 8 a.m. in the 3900 block of North Main Street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richard Willetts, who lives in the neighborhood, said he was on his way to Inez when his wife called him about a mattress burning on the lawn next door.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was an armored car and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> walking all around,&quot; Willetts said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Willetts' son, Griffin Milberger, arrived with his father on the scene as the military-style tank was pulling out of their neighbor's driveway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They blew out almost every window in the facility, and it's barely a two-bedroom cabin,&quot; said Milberger. &quot;They (the SWAT team members) do a good job; they're very quick and efficient.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Victoria </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were looking for stolen property linked to several crimes in the Victoria area, along with recent home invasion robberies that occurred earlier this week, according to a Victoria </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Department statement issued Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arrested were:--Damien Zuniga, 17, on suspicion of possession of stolen property, possession of less than 1 gram of a controlled substance and possession of less than 2 ounces of marijuana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">--Christopher Lee Gutierrez, 33, on suspicion of theft of property worth less than $500, the manufacturing and delivery of less than 200 grams of a controlled substance penalty and three outstanding traffic warrants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">--Henry Garcia Jr., 17, on suspicion of possession of stolen property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The suspects are connected to at least five crimes in Victoria, and they could possibly be charged with additional crimes, according to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detective Tanya Brown, a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> spokeswoman, said </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> took the extra precaution of the armored vehicle and SWAT members because of &quot;the nature of offenses the suspects committed, the violence used during the commission of the offenses (home invasion robberies) and the fact the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">suspects</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were believed to be </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7"> BODY:<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The counsel for the 50 year old Gregory Afoko, brother of New Patriotic Party's (NPP) National Chairman, Paul Afoko, yesterday argued in court that, the latter's name should be removed from the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fact Sheet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Afoko's Counsel, Ekow Ampah Korsah, his client was a citizen of Ghana with sound mind and of full legal age, who can sue and be sued and, therefore, there was no need for his brother's name to be attached to his. He told the court that, he did not understand why the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> should attach his brother's name, saying there was no need to attach him as a third party.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He further described attaching Paul Afoko's name in the charge sheet as prejudicial which should be removed. This generated heated argument between the prosecution and the defendants for some time. The Prosecutor, Superintendent Francis Baah, also argued that Paul Afoko's name cannot be removed because at that material moment, that was part of the facts they have gathered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The judge, however, declined the request that Paul Afoko's name should not be in the charge sheet, saying at that moment, the prosecutor has to present the facts as it is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the Magistrate court, presided over by Worlanyo Kotoku, refused the bail application submitted by the defend counsel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gregory Afoko was remanded into </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> custody to reappear on June 9, 2015, for his alleged role in the assassination of Adam Mahama, the party's Upper East Regional Chairman. He was arraigned before the court at about 11:15 am to face charges of Conspiracy to commit crime and murder yesterday. Meanwhile Asabke Alangdi, the other suspect is currently at large.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Background</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gregory Afoko was arrested by the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> following the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of Mahama Adams, the late Upper East regional chairman of the NPP. He and one other, Asabke Alangdi, were said to have been named by the deceased as the persons who poured substance believed to be acid on him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gregory Afoko appeared at the court premises at about 11:12 am with two </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> holding his arms, whilst still in handcuff. He bowed down to avoid the media from taking pictures of him when walking to the court room and his face was covered after the court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both families of Afoko and the late Mahama Adams were present in court, whilst the latter's family were clad in mourning cloths. He has been charged with murder. Adam Mahama was attacked by two persons last Thursday. Gregory Afoko was subsequently arrested in connection with the attack but the other accomplice is on the run.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facts</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deceased, Adams Mahama, until his untimely </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was a contractor and the Upper East Regional Chairman of the New Patriotic Party (NPP). First suspect, Gregory Afoko is a farmer, an NPP youth activist and a younger brother to Mr. Paul Afoko, National Chairman of the same party whiles the 2nd suspect, Asabke Alangdi is also a party member.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the early part of May, 2015, Mr. Paul Afoko and Kwabena Aygepong, National Chairman and General Secretary respectively of the NPP embarked on a tour. On 14th day of May, 2015, the National Chairman and General Secretary arrived in Bolgatanga. The deceased organized some thugs to violently attack them scuttling the planned meeting at Azumsolom Guest House for campaigning against the flagbearer, Nana Addo Danquah Akuffo Addo and also not notifying him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The situation was later brought under control by the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> First suspect was not impressed with the action taken by the regional chairman, as a result had serious confrontation with the deceased until he was chased away by the thugs. Later 1st and 2nd suspects mobilized some youth to form another group with their sole aim to protect party executives perceived to be against Nana Akuffo Addo's bid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The suspects and other members had series of meetings and in the evening of 20th May 2015, two assailants now identified as 1st and 2nd </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">suspects</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with a substance in a gallon suspected to be acid, laid ambush at the deceased residence. The deceased returned home around 11: 00pm in his pick-up vehicle with registration number NR 761-14 immediately he parked the vehicle in front of his, suspects went close, signaled him to roll down the glass. The deceased identified the suspects as party members, rolled down the glass to talk to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suddenly, the suspects poured the substance suspected to be acid on his head, face and other parts of his body and fled on a motorbike. The deceased started screaming for help and his wife, Hajia Zenabu Adams, came to the aid of the husband and managed to bring him out of the vehicle. In the process she sustained burns on the right side of the chest and breast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The wife enquired to know what happened to him and he told her that it was the 1st and 2nd suspects who poured the substance on him. The deceased who could not withstand the pains was still shouting and started removing his clothes. This attracted the attention of the neighbors who took him to the Upper East Regional Hospital. Deceased repeatedly mentioned the names of 1st and 2 suspects as the perpetrators to the neighbors and friends who came to his aid and rushed him to the hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the deceased was being prepared to be airlifted to Accra for intensive care, he was pronounced dead. During investigations, the 1st suspect was arrested in his house and when asked to lead to lead </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to the house of the 2nd suspect he rather took them to the father's house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> later located the house of 2nd suspect who had got wind of their presence and absconded with his wife leaving behind their baby. A gallon which contains some of the substance and a plastic cup were retrieved at the scene for forensic examination. Post mortem examination was conducted on the body of the deceased and the Pathologist gave the cause of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as Shock Lungs and Extensive Acid burns. However, investigation is still ongoing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul Kendall</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7"> BODY:<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Met (BBC One), the first episode of a new series about the Metropolitan </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was meant to be a fly-on-the-wall documentary. And yet it was so skilfully constructed that it felt more like a high-end drama, boasting the multistranded structure of acclaimed cop show The Wire and the acutely observed backroom politics of The West Wing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first part of the episode introduced us to Andy and Sarah from the force's armed SC&amp;019 unit. The second saw senior </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> planning their media response to the inquest into the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of Mark Duggan, the gang member whose </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at the hands of a firearms </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sparked the nationwide riots of August 2011.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We then saw the aftermath of that inquest, a controversial verdict of &quot;lawful killing&quot;, during which tensions between protesters and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> threatened to explode into violence once again. The cameras then moved to a fiery public meeting involving representatives of the black community, before a final thread took us to a potentially combustible street party in Brixton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This dramatic construction certainly made for good television. There was a tangible sense of trepidation during a raid on a flat belonging to an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed suspect,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and during the protests following the end of the inquest, when the cameras roamed in and out of a hostile crowd in front of Tottenham </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You also felt you were being given valuable insights into the work of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - not just the undeniably difficult job of the firearms </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> whose splitsecond decisions are held up to intense scrutiny, but also the Met's ongoing struggle to gain the trust of black Londoners, many of whom feel they have been demonised for decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The section in which </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> took preemptive action before the Brixton street party - unearthing knives that had been hidden in trees, locking up key gang members on minor charges so they were off the street - could have come straight out of The Wire, which revelled in the canny </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> work of experienced cops in the gangster-ridden housing projects of Baltimore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But one can't help thinking the person who will be most pleased with this polished product will be Met commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe. Frustrated by years of negative publicity and wary of his force's relationship with journalists following the Leveson inquiry, he has said he decided to open his doors to the BBC so the public could understand what the Met does.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a huge risk, but seeing the intense way in which </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> planned their media strategy prior to the Duggan verdict, you can't help feeling that Hogan-Howe knew exactly what he was doing. Each member of the force in that scene was shown to be thoughtful and committed. Would the BBC have been granted access if a certain level of control had not been agreed first?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How to be Bohemian (BBC Four), an entertaining history of &quot;painters, poets, pioneers and provocateurs&quot;, contained characters aplenty. There was French writer G&eacute;rard de Nerval who used to walk his pet lobster through the streets of Paris, textile designer William Morris, who lived in a love triangle with his wife Jane and the Pre-Raphaelite painter Rossetti, and, of course, Oscar Wilde, a man who revelled in shocking the middle classes. But the real star of the show was its presenter, Victoria Coren Mitchell who lent the programme (the first of three) the right tone with a combination of witty aper&ccedil;us and thoughtful commentary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is something inherently laughable about the early Bohemians - the friends of Th&eacute;ophile Gautier became famous in 19th century Paris for their naked garden parties - and Coren Mitchell was very much alive to this. (&quot;I imagine everyone had a lovely time but nobody wanted to hold the lobster,&quot; she said of the garden parties.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Bohemianism was also a deadly serious movement, a challenge to the received wisdoms of the ruling elite, and the source of important art, so the jokes often gave way to sincere editorialising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you live a fully conventional life,&quot; Coren Mitchell said at one point, &quot;it's much easier to disapprove of someone who doesn't than to wonder if they are happier than you are.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other point to make about Coren Mitchell is her enthusiasm. She seemed genuinely thrilled to be talking to the programme's contributors - from the writer Will Self to the painter Maggi Hambling. She even managed a smile during her conversation with the insufferable Rev Richard Coles.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE ACQUITTAL Saturday of a white Cleveland cop for firing the final blasts of a 137-shot </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> barrage that killed two unarmed blacks ignited instant outrage and protests.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Demonstrators seething over the acquittal of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Michael Brelo, 31, flooded the streets following the verdict - leading to dozens of arrests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As darkness cloaked the city, groups of protesters clashed with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in riot gear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Demonstrators also got into a fight with patrons at a downtown restaurant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three people were led away in handcuffs and charged with felony assault and aggravated riot, authorities said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A fourth person was charged with assault after throwing an unknown object through a window and injuring a female patron.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By early Sunday, cops had arrested roughly 40 people, including a reporter for Northeast Ohio Media Group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brelo, 31, was the only one of the 13 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who opened fire to face criminal charges in the November 2012 incident - and a Cleveland judge found him not guilty in the bench trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors charged Brelo unloaded 49 shots, including a 15-bullet fusillade while standing on the hood of the car and blasting through the windshield at victims Timothy Russell, 43, and Malissa Williams, 30.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brelo wept, held his head in his hands and occasionally made the sign of the cross as Judge John O'Donnell found him not guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting followed a 62-car, 100 mph chase that one prosecutor said looked like a clip from the movie &quot;The Blues Brothers.&quot; The chase was triggered in downtown Cleveland after cops reacted to what they believed was a gunshot, but was instead Russell's Chevy Malibu backfiring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For more than 20 miles, the phalanx of cops chased Russell's 1979 Malibu. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> unloaded on the vehicle after finally cornering it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Russell was shot 23 times, and Williams was struck by 24 bullets. Neither </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">victim was armed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inside the vehicle, investigators discovered a crack pipe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge John O'Donnell acknowledged that Brelo fired lethal shots at the victims but ruled that the evidence didn't prove his shots caused either </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Russell's family blasted the judge's decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Fleeing is not grounds for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; the family said in a statement. &quot;The exoneration of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Brelo speaks to a complete disregard for the extreme and unnecessary force meted out against some American citizens who happen to be black and brown.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 200 angry but mostly peaceful protesters immediately took to the Cleveland streets, some carrying signs asking, &quot;Will I be next?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The demonstrators marched through the city's downtown - at times squaring off with cops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three protesters were handcuffed and taken into </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> custody near Quicken Loans Arena.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> held up pepper spray as protesters surged toward those who had been arrested, but tensions quickly cooled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Racial tensions in Cleveland were already strained by the killing six months ago of Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old black boy shot to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by a rookie white cop. The preteen was carrying a pellet gun.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">May 17--Decatur </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are investigating whether a string of shootings overnight Friday that left two men dead are related.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> spokesman Lt. John Crouch said that at about 10 p.m. Friday </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> found the body of a 27-year-old man riddled with what appeared to be bullet wounds near the carport of a home in the 100 block of Albert Street Southwest. Morgan County District Attorney Scott Anderson and Coroner Jeff Chunn also responded to the scene. The victim's identity was being withheld pending notification of family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 9 a.m. Saturday, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> received reports of a dead Hispanic male near Adventure Park, located in Wilson Morgan Park at 300 Beltline Road S.W. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said he was shot in the head and that the shootings could be related to other violent incidents that occurred overnight Friday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The identity of the second victim also has not been released.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chunn said both bodies were taken to Huntsville Forensic Sciences for autopsies. He said he wasn't sure if both </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deaths</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are related.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't have anything directly related, but that is a possibility,&quot; Chunn said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shots were also fired into a home on the 600 block of Fifth Avenue Southwest about 9 p.m. Friday. No one was harmed. The residents said the shots came from a silver Nissan Altima occupied by multiple black males.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> also responded to a robbery at 11:30 p.m. in the 1600 block of Eighth Avenue Southwest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The victim had her 5-year-old daughter in the back seat of her car when she went inside the home to turn down her daughter's bed, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said. When she returned to the car to get her daughter, she was approached by two black males who wore all black and ski masks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The victim said they came out of a light-colored Nissan Altima, and one was </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with a long, black gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">victim</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said the suspects demanded her money or else they were going to kill her daughter. The victim gave the suspects her purse in response. The suspects left in the Altima, and no one was harmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shots were fired into a home in the 400 block of Fifth Avenue Southwest about 12:30 a.m. Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The victim in that incident told </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> she was sitting on her couch when she heard multiple gunshots and glass breaking. She took refuge in a bathroom, where she called </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> found multiple bullet holes on the side of the house. A witness to the shooting said she saw a silver Nissan Altima with a black bumper drive away from the house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A man claiming to be robbed came to the front desk of the Decatur </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Department about 1:15 a.m. He said he was riding his bike near 11th Avenue and Second Street Northwest when two black males dressed in black exited a silver four-door car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One was armed with a shotgun, while the other was armed with a handgun. One of the men demanded his belongings, while a third man remained in the car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The victim said he turned and ran, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said. He then heard one individual tell another man to shoot him, but no shots were fired, and no one was harmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Response</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anderson said he couldn't release details about the shootings and the slayings because the cases are still being investigated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Law enforcement is putting every man they can on this,&quot; Anderson said. &quot;We need to wait and see what we're dealing with here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are asking for any tips that may lead to the suspects' arrests. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are offering a $1,000 reward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anyone who might have seen an older model bronze or silver Nissan Altima with a dark colored bumper or a group of black males dressed all in black last night or who might have any other information related to any of these cases is asked to call </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at 256-476-7638.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Huge crowds and high rollers in Las Vegas for the Floyd Mayweather-Manny Pacquiao fight helped Nevada casinos make more than $1 billion off gamblers in May, according to records released yesterday. It was the first time casinos exceeded that total in more than a year. &quot;To hit a billion, we're pretty pleased,&quot; said Nevada Gaming Control Board analyst Michael Lawton said. Slot machines and tables were packed on fight night, May 2, and casinos responded by raising limits to accommodate big spenders. It was the start of a busy month that included the new Rock in Rio outdoor music festival, the World Series of Poker and Memorial Day weekend.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Walt Disney World is banning selfie sticks from its theme parks, citing safety concerns, a company spokeswoman said yesterday morning. Under a new policy, which takes effect Tuesday, the poles won't make it past the bag check at any Disney World theme park. The sticks also won't be allowed in Disney World water parks or DisneyQuest, a gaming attraction at Downtown Disney. Selfie sticks will also become forbidden at Disneyland Resort in California on Tuesday. The prohibition kicks in at Disney's parks in Paris and Hong Kong on July 1.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7"> BODY:<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AS he reached the white door, ajar at his cousin's home in Durbanville's Fisantekraal, Ivan Ska was met by the horrific sight of the cousin pleading with his hands but unable to utter a word as blood streamed from his head where he'd been shot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And on the injured man's chest, lay his two-year-old baby girl, her tiny waist bloodied after one of three gunmen had hit her with a single bullet in her stomach.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking in front of this house of horrors, Skai, 42, said on Saturday evening, he had been making a fire to cook supper when he heard screams nearby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Someone alerted him that his cousin, Mongezi Gamtele, 35, had been gunned down at home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He rushed to find the tragic scene of Gamtele taking his last breaths while his daughter, Nosipho Gamtele, 2, clung to life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I got such a fright when I got to my cousin's house. He was lying in the doorway with his hands in the air but he couldn't speak. His face was full of blood and the child was on his chest also bleeding,&quot; recalled Skai.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were then alerted and Gamtele was later declared dead at the scene while the toddler was rushed to Red Cross War Memorial Children's |Hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hospital spokeswoman Angelique Jordaan said the little girl was recovering after having undergone surgery to remove the bullet lodged in her abdomen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She is currently in a stable condition and doing well,&quot; she added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is alleged that three </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> men had gained access to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">victim's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> home after posing as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> dressed in civilian clothing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Gamtele not there at the time, the gunmen had demanded his girlfriend call him to rush home. Upon his arrival, just in front of his shack, the men took his firearm and shot him in the head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They then turned a gun on the couple's daughter and shot her in the stomach before they fled the scene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Skai thinks that his cousin, whom he fondly referred to as Mongi, had been targeted for his licensed firearm and said that it was not the first break-in at Gamtele's house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The family is all not okay... Mongi didn't drink, he didn't smoke, he just worked and even made videos in his free time,&quot; said Skai.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Funeral arrangements will be finalised this weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gamtele's neighbour Sicelo Smith, 26, said he was shocked by the murder of Gamtele who had been a &quot;friendly man&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the area had a &quot;very high&quot; crime rate, adding that &quot;even now I'm scared for my safety, we want more </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are still hunting for the gunmen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> spokesman Colonel Tembinkosi Kinana confirmed that there were no new developments in the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Situated about 5km from Durbanville, the Fisantekraal community is reported to have grown substantially and crime has escalated in the area which has seen &quot;increased unemployment and surrounding business closures&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Durbanville Community Policing Forum (CPF) says it has repeatedly asked for the satellite </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> station serving Fisantekraal to be converted into a fully-fledged station, something the forum says is a &quot;matter of urgency&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chairwoman of the forum, Lesley Ashton, said cable theft at the satellite station when telephone lines were stolen, hampered communication with the central </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> station which often resulted in slower response times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fisantekraal, Ashton added, only had one dedicated </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> vehicle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rising crime trends in the area included robberies, assaults, break-ins and armed robberies. In some of the incidents the CPF said &quot;plastic imitation firearms&quot; had been |confiscated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ashton said the forum and community were strongly asking the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> authorities and the Department of Community Safety and other roleplayers for another </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The loss of a father and an injured child due to crime is a very sad way to draw attention once again to the recognised shortfalls in ensuring the safety and security of the greater Durbanville community,&quot; she added.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">COMCAST FOUNDER, PIONEER OF CABLE TELEVISION DIES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK - Ralph Roberts, a businessman with a gentle demeanor who built Comcast from a small cable TV system in Mississippi into one of the nation's largest entertainment companies, has died. He was 95.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Comcast says in a statement that Mr. Roberts died Thursday night in Philadelphia of natural causes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Roberts jumped into the fledgling cable TV industry in 1963 by spending $500,000 to buy American Cable Systems, a company in Tupelo, Miss. He then acquired other cable systems, changed the name of the company to Comcast and ran the company until he was in his 80s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He handed control of the company to one of his sons, Brian Roberts, who is now Comcast's chairman and CEO. The younger Mr. Roberts expanded beyond his father's vision and led Comcast to own NBCUniversal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A graduate of the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, Roberts also served in the U.S. Navy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was a well-known philanthropist in Philadelphia, supporting such efforts as Project H.O.M.E., an outreach program for the homeless. HIGH COURT STRIKES DOWN ARIZ. SIGN ORDINANCE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON - The Supreme Court on Thursday struck down an Arizona town's ordinance that treated signs directing people to a small church's worship services differently than signs with other messages, such as a political candidate's advertisement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision was unanimous in favor of the tiny Good News Community Church, which has a long-running dispute with the town of Gilbert, Ariz., over signs planted in public rights of way directing congregants to church meeting places.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the justices split over the correct way to decide the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five justices joined Justice Clarence Thomas's decision that the town's regulations are based on the content of the sign's message and thus require the court's highest First Amendment protection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The town &quot;singles out specific subject matter for differential treatment, even if it does not target viewpoints within that subject matter,&quot; Mr. Thomas wrote. &quot;Ideological messages are given more favorable treatment than messages concerning a political candidate, which are themselves given more favorable treatment than messages announcing an assembly of like-minded individuals.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Thomas wrote, &quot;That is a paradigmatic example of content-based discrimination.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">OFFICER,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SUSPECT DEAD AFTER SHOOTOUT</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CINCINNATI - Cincinnati's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> chief says a policeman and an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed suspect</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who were shot during a gunfight with other </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chief Jeffrey Blackwell says the 27-year </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> veteran died after the shooting this morning in the Madisonville neighborhood. He said the suspect was also killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blackwell said multiple shots were fired between the suspect and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> responding to a 911 call. The chief says he believes the suspect was on the street when </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> arrived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting comes nine days after Cincinnati </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> released a plan for dealing with a recent surge of gun violence in the city.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A HUGE manhunt was under way today after a white gunman opened fire in an African-American church and killed nine people, including a pastor, in a race-hate attack.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The killer burst into the building in Charleston, South Carolina, spraying bullets at his victims as they took part in a Bible study session. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> released the first image of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">suspect</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, describing him as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and dangerous. The massacre took place in Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church last night. Eight victims were killed in the building and the ninth died in hospital. The pastor, state senator Clementa Pinckney, 41, was among the dead. Another person was injured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to local reports, the gunman let one woman escape so she could tell the story, and a girl of five survived by playing dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detectives said the gunman was white, 21 to 25, slender and about 5ft 9ins tall. He wore a grey top, blue jeans and boots, and fled in a black sedan. City </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> chief Gregory Mullen appealed to the public to help catch him, saying the FBI had joined the hunt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I do believe it was a hate crime,&quot; he added. &quot;This is a tragedy no community should experience, senseless, unfathomable. We are going to do everything in our power to find this individual, to lock him up, to make sure he does not hurt anyone else.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the scene was chaotic when </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> arrived. They thought a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> dog had tracked the trail of the suspect, but he got away. Dot Scott, president of the Charleston National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said a survivor told her family the gunman sat down in the church before opening fire, and told her he was letting her live so she could tell the world what happened. Family members said a fiveyear-old girl survived after she was told to play dead by her grandmother.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charleston Mayor Joseph Riley said: &quot;It was a heartbreaking scene. The only reason someone could walk into a church and shoot people praying is hate. It is the most dastardly act that one could possibly imagine.&quot; Soon after the attack a bomb threat was made at the building, but the all-clear was given. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with dogs searched the streets as a helicopter hovered overhead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Set up in 1816, Emanuel is one of the oldest African-American churches. One of its founders, former slave Denmark Vesey, tried to organise a slave revolt in 1822. Landowners burned his church burnt in revenge. @KiranRandhawa</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two innocent students were killed in a raid by security forces, but Fatoni University in Pattani is intent on ending the cycle of violence</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We were building good citizens for a stronger nation, you came and tore them down, said the rector of Fatoni University. We have been left devastated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That was the powerful statement made by assistant professor Ismaillutfi Japakiya on April 7, responding to a committee of military men, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and community leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The committee was trying to explain why four innocent young men - including two final year students at Fatoni University - were shot dead in a bungled security raid in Pattani's Thung Yang Daeng district on March 25.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an attempt to quell outrage among locals, Fourth Army Region commander Lt Gen Prakarn Cholayuth ordered Pattani governor Weerapong Kaewsuwan to appoint a committee to investigate the incident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The victims of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">fatal</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> village raid, in which 22 were also detained for questioning, had been accused of involvement with the RKK insurgent group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the committee found the four dead men had nothing to do with the group, were not militants and were not carrying any weapons at the time of the raid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Ismaillutfi broke into tears as he accepted an apology from Lt Gen Prakarn. Even though this does not end today, I am at least glad to know that our children are innocent, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A CHANCE TO LEARN</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fatoni University and its rector had always had a fairly low profile within Thailand, although it is well-known in the Islamic world. But since the Thung Yang Daeng tragedy and unprecedented military apology, the university has been thrust into the spotlight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fatoni University was known as Yala Islamic University when it was established in 1996. It was originally located on a 43-rai plot in Muang district, Yala province. Construction was funded by the Islamic Development Bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Ismaillutfi founded the university to serve all Muslims in the deep South, with the intention of bringing peace to the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only way to solve the problems here is to introduce education to the area, he told Spectrum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before Fatoni was set up, Thai Muslims who wanted to join an Islamic university had to travel to another country, such as Saudi Arabia or Egypt. Mr Ismaillutfi was one such student, and spent 13 years in Saudi Arabia from 1973 to 1986, studying all the way from bachelor's degree level to gaining a doctorate in philosophy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he remembers feeling isolated as a student abroad, and said the Thai embassy at the time did little to take care of Thai Muslims in Saudi Arabia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They treated me like I was not a Thai citizen, Mr Ismaillutfi said, recalling how he felt neglected by officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The experience made him consider the plight of other Thai students in similar situations, and got him thinking about how to improve access to a quality Islamic education closer to home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five years after returning to Thailand, Mr Ismaillutfi was invited to a Ministry of Foreign Affairs conference to talk about the issues he faced during his time in Saudi Arabia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told the audience that problems in the deep South might be linked to the fact that government officials always treat Thai Muslims like outsiders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He warned that Thai Muslim students often develop stronger bonds with their host nations than with Thailand, adding that many graduate and come home to work as teachers, but request funding from the country where they studied as opposed to Thai sources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PROVING THEM WRONG</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Ismaillutfi realised that opening an Islamic university in Thailand could be the answer to many of the problems he wanted to help solve. He started developing a plan to push forward the project, but it wasn't as easy as he had hoped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When he first came back from Saudi Arabia, he was monitored by Thai officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The continuous pressure started to take its toll, and he almost left the country when officials accused him of being involved with an insurgency group in the deep South.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But his father convinced him to stay where he belonged in Thailand, and to prove security officials wrong by continuing to be an upstanding member of society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Things gradually improved. Ten years after coming home, he was finally in a position to put his plan into action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Ismaillutfi established his university in Yala, integrating Islamic teaching with vocational education so that all students could learn skills to make a living.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The university opened in 1996 but wasn't officially approved until 1998, under the name Yala Islamic College.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first 200 students were enrolled to learn Islamic Law and Usuluddin, which is a programme of Islamic Studies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2004, the university moved its main campus to a 200-rai plot in Pattani, funded by donors from Saudi Arabia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The majority of the university's operations are now run from Pattani, while the Yala campus hosts an international programme for foreign students. The university has more than 4,000 Thai and international students.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CLASH OF FAITHS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vast majority of Muslims in Thailand are Sunni, but despite subscribing to the same branch of the religion, people are still divided by differing beliefs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a source who asked to remain anonymous, Fatoni University is considered to teach the new path of Islam. The new path is stricter in terms of religious practice and Islamic law, but more liberal and peaceful, the source said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new path aims to support Muslims to follow the teachings of the Koran, while adopting lessons from the academic world to apply to modern life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The old path, on the other hand, is more nationalistic. Its approach to the Koran is the same, but those who follow the old path do not see themselves as Thai, but as citizens of Pattani state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We don't hate each other, but we believe in different things, said another local source. We always know who follows which path, but it is just a matter of different beliefs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those who adhere to the new path believe that knowledge can solve problems and try to access education from mainstream schools and university. But believers in the old path only send their children to Islamic schools, known locally as Pornoh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">REJECTING BLOODSHED</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While some use violence to try and get their own way, Mr Ismaillutfi favours a different approach. He sees education as a sustainable means to ending turmoil in the South.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since I started the university, my slogan has been that we must foster positive lives before careers, Mr Ismaillutfi said. People must understand their life purpose before knowing what they want to do for a living.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the rector, that means supporting students to develop high moral values, and helping them consider how their actions affect society as a whole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Ismaillutfi has tailored the curriculum at the university to achieving this goal, and his course in Peace Studies is compulsory for all students in order to graduate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He use lessons in the Koran as a key part of teaching the subject, since Islam advocates peaceful approaches to solving problems, and the world Islam itself means peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to his academic work, Mr Ismaillutfi is also co-chairman of the Religions for Peace Inter-Religious Council of Thailand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He used his experience on the council to help design the Peace Studies curriculum around the concept of peace in all five religions officially recognised in Thailand: Buddhism, Islam, Christianity, Hinduism and Sikhism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rector argues that using peace to fight injustice strengthens the case of the oppressed. He said his Peace Studies course doesn't aim to stop people fighting for what they believe in, but teaches them how to fight in a peaceful manner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 100 years ago the government came into our area and violently abused us, Mr Ismaillutfi said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It didn't solve anything. In fact, it made the situation worse and locals have been trying to fight back using the same violent approach since then.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AT THE CENTRE OF ASEAN</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ongoing violence in the deep South means the university is located in a safety red zone. However, foreign students still choose to come and study there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number of overseas students has been rising steadily every year. Fatoni now has 200 foreign students enrolled, from 12 countries including Cambodia, China, Myanmar and Laos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Assistant professor Sukree Langputeh, the deputy rector for academic affairs and research at the university, told Spectrum that schools in China are impressed with the education their students receive in Thailand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The schools had previously sent their students to study in the Middle East, but when those young people returned to China they seemed a bit rough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, students returning from Thailand exhibit a different attitude. The Chinese schools say they seem friendly, gentle and peaceful - like Muslim people from the south of Thailand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another factor that makes Fatoni University popular is that foreign students can learn a range of languages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If they study in Saudi Arabia, they can only learn Arabic, but here they can learn Thai, Malay, English and Arabic, Mr Sukree said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The forthcoming Asean Economic Community means that many Muslim students from across Asia, especially the Chinese, see Pattani as a hub for business opportunities with other Asean countries, he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have taught Chinese entrepreneurs who own businesses in Malaysia, Mr Sukree explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They said coming to study here was great since they could learn the Malay language and be close to Malaysia, which benefits their businesses in the long term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Mr Ismaillutfi addressed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs conference 14 years ago, things started to get better for Thai Muslims who went to study abroad. Officials made more effort to interact with them and helped build networks between isolated students.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However the rector is convinced that studying at home provides the best option for Thai Muslims. He says students benefit from understanding the national culture and politics, and from developing a sense of civic duty and morality within that context.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Ismaillutfi now wants all schools in Thailand to start teaching a form of Peace Studies, arguing that peace is the only way to solve violence and political conflicts in all corners of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My students wouldn't have lost their lives and others will not die in the future if everyone chooses to solve their problems with peace, he said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">BY EDGAR SANDOVAL in Charleston, S.C. RACHELLE BLIDNER and LARRY McSHANE With Cameron Joseph</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7"> BODY:<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ONE WEEK before his arrest for a racist rampage at a revered Southern church, Dylann Storm Roof shared an apocalyptic vision of mass murder with a trailer park neighbor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was looking to kill a bunch of people,&quot; recalled Christon Scriven, 22, just hours before his bigoted buddy's arrest for a racially motivated killing spree. &quot;He flat out told us he was going to do this stuff. He's just off in the head . . . Weird.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hate-fueled white gunman was busted Thursday morning after a 14-hour manhunt, suspected in the execution of nine helpless black worshippers inside the historic Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The innocent, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unarmed victims</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ranged in age from 26 to 87 - and included the venerable church's pastor, an acquaintance of President Obama and First Lady Michelle.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chilling details emerged about Roof's racist rants inside the church, the ignored pleas of his victims as he reloaded his handgun five times - and his release of one terrified woman to serve as a witness to the carnage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The shooter said, 'I'm not going to shoot you because I want you to tell everyone what happened,' &quot; Charleston NAACP chapter President Dot Scott told a local newspaper, the Post and Courier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roof arrived at 8 p.m. for the Wednesday prayer meeting, bringing a heart filled with evil and a fully loaded handgun, officials said. He spent an hour with his victims before declaring his murderous intent with a merciless four-word announcement: &quot;You have to go.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sylvia Johnson, a cousin of the slain pastor, the Rev. Clementa Pinckney, told MSNBC that a survivor recounted how Roof delivered one final crazed comment before the shooting started.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have to do it,&quot; he was quoted as saying. &quot;You rape our women and you're taking over our country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eight of the victims were found dead inside the house of worship with two centuries of history, while the ninth died in the operating room of a nearby hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three people survived the bloodshed, although authorities released no details about the fortunate trio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roof, 21, a high school dropout and accused drug user, was nabbed after driving 245 miles from the church parking lot to the town of Shelby, N.C. - where a woman recognized his black Hyundai and Three Stooges-style bowl haircut.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A terrible human being who would go into a place of worship where people are praying and kill them is now in custody - where he will always remain,&quot; said Charleston Mayor Joseph Riley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mass slaying of the pastor and his flock during an evening Bible study session was immediately labeled a hate crime, even as it echoed sad chapters from America's violent past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama invoked the killing of four black girls in a 1963 Birmingham, Ala., church bombing by the Ku Klux Klan. And the shooting spree harkened to mass killings at the Sandy Hook Elementary School, a Colorado movie theater and the carnage at Virginia Tech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The fact that this took place in a black church obviously . . . raises questions about a dark part of our history,&quot; the President declared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Obama also took aim at a Congress that has repeatedly rebuffed White House efforts on gun control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At some point, we as a country will have to reckon with the fact that this type of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And it is in our power to do something about it. I say that, recognizing the politics in this town foreclose a lot of those avenues right now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama noted that he and his wife personally knew some parishioners at the church - including its slain pastor, who was also a South Carolina politician.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In other developments:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The FBI learned of Roof's identity when childhood friend Joey Meek, 20, recognized his skinny friend's face and grimy gray sweatshirt in a surveillance camera frame grab from the church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I didn't THINK it was him,&quot; Meek said. &quot;I KNEW it was him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Roof waived both his right to extradition and his right to counsel at a 10-minute North Carolina hearing, clearing the way for his Thursday night return to South Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Cops released Roof's 2015 rap sheet: A Feb. 28 bust for possession of a controlled substance in the local mall and an April 26 arrest for trespassing at the same mall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* An ominous Facebook photo showed the demented mass murder suspect glaring into the camera while wearing a black jacket decorated with an apartheid-era South African flag.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Roof's father, Ben, refused to comment, calling the cops on a reporter at his South Carolina home. The suspect's uncle said the dad's 21st birthday present to Roof in April was a .45-caliber handgun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The South Carolina state Legislature came under fire when the Confederate flag, a symbol of the Civil War and slavery, flew at full staff above the Statehouse after the racist murders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The multiple murder suspect's sister, 27-year-old Amber, is scheduled to get married Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* None of the GOP presidential hopefuls - Sens. Marco Rubio, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz - linked gun control to the mass killing at the annual Faith &amp; Freedom Coalition's convention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton said the time for legislation was now. &quot;We have to be honest,&quot; she said Thursday. &quot;How many people do we need to see cut down before we act?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charleston County Coroner Rae Wooten read off the sad litany of victims' names, noting all were shot to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> without giving any specifics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The best known was the well-respected Rev. Pinckney, 41, who served as both pastor and state senator. Pinckney, the father of two girls and a preaching prodigy since age 13, was elected to the Statehouse at 23 - making him the youngest member of the House at the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three other church officials were also killed: Sharonda Coleman-Singleton, 45, Daniel Simmons, 74, and Mira Thompson, 59. Other victims included longtime parishioner Susie Jackson, 87, and one-time church janitor Ethel Lance, 70.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The others killed were identified as public library branch manager Cynthia Hurd, 54; college enrollment counselor DePayne Doctor, 49; and recent college graduate Tywanza Sanders, 26.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roof's appearance at the church meeting did not alarm any of the worshippers, who are used to drop-ins from tourists visiting the historical building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Authorities said the arrest of the suspect came without incident at 10:49 a.m. after a local citizen called </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to report she had spied Roof in his getaway car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roof, roughly 25 minutes after he was stopped by cops, surrendered quietly. Charleston </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chief Greg Mullen characterized the killer as &quot;cooperative&quot; as he was taken into custody by local </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers. Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">suspect</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was still </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> when approached by cops. Authorities believe Roof acted alone in planning and executing the lethal attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A woman on her way to work at a Shelby florist recognized Roof's black Hyundai on Highway 74 and called her boss - who in turn dialed the cops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I knew it was a black car . . . I saw pictures of him with the bowl cut,&quot; a teary Debbie Dills told the Shelby Star newspaper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roof was fitted by cops with a bulletproof vest and shackles on his hands and feet before he was taken from the local </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> station to court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roof's trailer park pal Scriven, who is black, said the suspected shooter initially plotted to target the College of Charleston and not the church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You don't know when to take him seriously and when not to,&quot; said Scriven. &quot;To be honest, I didn't react (to the news). I was like, 'Awww man, he did that s---.' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said his niece Emily was once in the same eighth-grade class as Roof - described by the GOP presidential hopeful as &quot;one of these whacked out kids.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Graham, after speaking with his sister Darline Nordone and his niece, told CNN that his relatives had nothing positive to say about Roof.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was quiet, strange, very anti-social and everyone thought he was on drugs,&quot; said Graham. &quot;. . . It's about a young man who is obviously twisted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roof could face the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> penalty under South Carolina law or federal hate crime statutes if the case goes that route.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An antiterrorism court on Friday remanded Muttahida Qaumi Movement leader Amir Khan in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> custody for a week in a case pertaining to instigating terrorism and harbouring criminals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The MQM leader was picked up along with dozens of other suspects by the Rangers in a pre-dawn raid on and around the party headquarters Nine Zero in Azizabad some three months ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While placing them under 90-day preventive detention, the paramilitary force had informed a court that they had credible information about their alleged involvement in offences related to targeted killing and terrorism.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On June 4, the Rangers handed over the MQM leader to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> after registering a case against him and others for allegedly harbouring criminals and using them for terrorist activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amid tight security arrangements, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Friday produced Amir Khan before the ATC and the investigating </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sought his custody for two weeks for questioning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the judge of the ATC-II handed over the MQM leader to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on physical remand for one week and asked the investigating </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to produce him at the next hearing along with a progress report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui and other party leaders were also present in the court during the hearing, while dozens of female activists of the MQM staged a protest demonstration outside the court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the FIR, the Rangers during the March 11 raid had arrested 26 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed suspects</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> including Faisal Mehmood alias Mota, who was sentenced to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by a court in absentia for the murder of journalist Wali Khan Babar; Obaid alias K2, who was wanted in many cases; and Noman alias Nomi, an absconder in the Advocate Niamat Ali Randhawa murder case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides, 59 others suspects, including Amir Khan, had also been arrested during the raid and placed under preventive detention, the FIR added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It alleged that the MQM leader and others admitted during questioning that Amir Khan was in charge of the party headquarters security and he along with Minhaj Qazi, Raees Mama, Shahzad Mullah, Imran Ijaz Niazi and Naeem alias Mullah had allegedly provided shelter to arrested criminals and had been using them for terrorist activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A joint investigation team (JIT) recommended the registration of a case against the MQM leader and others, it concluded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case was registered against Amir Khan and others under Sections 11V (directing terrorist activities), 21J (harbouring any person who committed an offence under this act) and 7 (punishment for act of terrorism) of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 on a complaint of Deputy Superintendent Rangers Ashraf Hussain at the Azizabad </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The offences in question carry life imprisonment and confiscation of assets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the hearing, MQM leader Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui said they were being politically victimised. He said his party had faced similar accusations in the past also. He added that the party was being pushed to the wall and Amir Khan was falsely implicated in the case as the suspects had not been declared criminals yet by courts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">38 suspects released</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the paramilitary force submitted release orders of 38 suspects, including former MQM lawmaker Yusuf Munir Sheikh, to the ATC after they had been found guiltless during interrogation, it emerged on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the release order, the Rangers said that in the light of the recommendations of JIT reports, the Sachal section commander of the Rangers ordered their release for they were no more required for questioning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 38 suspects, who had been taken into custody during the March 11 raid, were released during the current and past weeks.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 39-year-old woman triggered her main parachute at 4,000 ft but it did not open up.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She survived only because her reserve chute deployed just in time to stop her smashing into the ground below.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have now arrested a man following the terrifying incident at a military airfield in Wiltshire. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said it was a miracle she did not die.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Concerned fellow skydivers had alerted detectives to their suspicions that the woman's parachute had been tampered with. And </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> found evidence that 'slinks' - connectors that join the parachute's canopy to its harness - had been deliberately removed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The incident unfolded when the experienced skydiver was carrying out a routine jump at Netheravon Airfield on Salisbury Plain on April 5. The woman, from Amesbury in Wiltshire, was taken to Southampton hospital with 'multiple serious injuries', including broken ribs and legs. She is recovering at home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wiltshire </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have questioned many members of the parachute club but want any other witnesses to the incident to come forward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'This woman would have been dead if her chute hadn't partially opened,' said Detective Inspector Paul Franklin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'This meant her descent was slowed enough for her to survive the fall. However, we were alerted to concerns over what had happened by the parachute club and as a result instigated an investigation. In particular, we are looking for slinks that were missing from the parachute which may have been removed and discarded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'This woman survived this fall miraculously but, despite her experience, she very nearly lost her life.' Detectives took a 35-year-old man into custody for questioning on suspicion of attempted murder. He was later released on bail.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am so sick and tired of hearing about Montessori children. Please, give me a break.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I believe are good </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and maybe 1 percent or less are bad </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. I think with the way the media treats </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that if I were one, I would want to quit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I also get phone calls from my name and number. It's from a credit card company wanting to lower my interest. I just hang up.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican Party should just change their name to the Koch Brothers Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why can't we get the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to come and arrest drug dealers?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The owners of the restaurants in Charleston should buy generators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If cursive is taught in the third grade, why do we still have a class of 13 and 14 year olds that can neither read nor write cursive?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I applaud the County Commissioners for going after the PSC and the rate hikes on these utilities. I just wish it had happened several years ago when the water and electric companies kept getting raise after raise every year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does a foster child who is adopted have a social worker or someone to watch over the parents and the wellness of the child? This is very important information that I need.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's my understanding that cursive writing is not taught in school now in any grade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is extremely poor planning to block the Southside Bridge ramp two days in a row. The cops there do not know how to direct traffic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As far as food trucks parking in front of restaurants goes, that needs to be stopped. The restaurants have a real investment in the city of Charleston and pay property taxes, business taxes and so forth. The food trucks may pay business taxes, but that's about it. All they're doing is using the established business as their draw and then stealing their business. That needs to be stopped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the United States was made up of organs like the human body West Virginia would be the large intestine. Full of wastes and getting out is the only option for relief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Can the Gazette inform the public as to the status of the penalty given those rioters and looters in Baltimore? If any?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When they determine who aided in the escape of the two convicted murderers from the New York prison, give them the same sentence as the two escapees. If there is any loss of life from this escape, then the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> penalty should be considered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charleston City Ordinance Section 114-706 clearly states: &quot;No person shall ride any bicycle upon any sidewalk within the city except where, by ordinance, the council of the city has designated such sidewalk as an official bicycle route and has marked such sidewalk with appropriate signs to that effect.&quot; Why will the Charleston </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> not enforce this ordinance?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Which genius legislators thought it'd be a good idea to rob me of my right to know who's carrying a concealed weapon in my vicinity? As usual, this is a law the consequences of which fall most heavily on women. If a deranged stalker has already violated a restraining order, it would seem important for the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">victim</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to know he's now </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> wouldn't you think?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The person complaining about Mountain Justice camping at Kanawha State Forest will be glad to know that they paid full price for the shelters for the entire week, providing much needed revenue to support the Forest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the Legislature requires all Welfare recipients to take drug tests in order to receive benefits then I think the Legislature should be required to pass IQ tests in order to write such legislation. Fair is fair!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sure would appreciate some repair to the St. Albans stop lights. Sitting waaaaay too long for light changes!!!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">West Virginia's DOH, if the department is out of finances, they should look at themselves as a business. Things to look for: too many roads (need to decommission some), too many unneeded supervisor's (higher paychecks). This would give some wasted money to cut grass, fix potholes and maybe pave some roads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If anyone in Winfield other than the elected officials has requested a new city hall, as the mayor claims is one reason to annex 200 acres that conveniently has 30 plus businesses (more b&amp;o taxes), please publish your names in the paper so all can see. Hurricane and now Winfield have to have the most greedy scum of all WV towns. Oops, forgot about Dollar Danny of Charleston.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7"> BODY:<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In recent times, there has been a rising wave of crime rates, especially in Lagos, which has continued to put residents and visitors to the megacity in palpable fear of being </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">victims</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of attacks from hoodlums and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> bandits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burdened with the enormous challenge of curtailing the rising crime rate in the state, the state </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Command, has advised Governor Akinwunmi Ambode to provide combat-ready helicopters for its men and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to mount surveillance across the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rising crime rate in the state, hit the head, last Friday, following the murder of one Sodiq in the Mushin area of the state. Sodiq, it was said, was murdered in cold blood by unknown gunmen, around 2pm, shortly after Jumaat service. The killings in the area which was becoming a recurring decimal irked residents, who protested at the Lagos State House of Assembly, to register their displeasure.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking on behalf of the aggrieved residents, Mr. Abiodun Leshi, explained that the affected streets that have lost sleep in recent times were Taniolodo, Lawani and Ojelawe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a related development, there is a fresh battle by Lagos State Government to tackle the resurgence of motorcycle operators popularly called Okada riders in all the 475 restricted roads including bridges and highways in the state. Recall that the last administration of Babatunde Fashola, in 2012, signed the Lagos Road Traffic Bill into law, restricting operations of okada riders from specific roads in the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At onset, there was high compliance by the riders, but towards the 2015 general elections, there was an explosion in the resurgence of riders across the state, even on restricted routes. Angered that the riders apparently took advantage of election period to flout the law, the state government last weekend, issued a 48-hour ultimatum to the recalcitrant okada riders, not to ply the 475 restricted roads, including bridges and highways. It warned that failure to adhere to the law, both the rider and the passengers, will be prosecuted by a Special Taskforce it has set-up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, on the increasing crime rate in the state, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police officers,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> particularly Divisional </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police Officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Area Commanders, who spoke during an interactive session with Ambode, last week, at the Oduduwa </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Command in Ikeja, lamented that the perennial traffic gridlocks in the metropolis was affecting prompt arrival of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at crime scenes, adding that the situation calls for the need of aerial patrol across the state to stem the tide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other complaints tabled before the governor was that the helicopters procured by the last administration were not fully equipped to combat-ready standard, that the daily increase in the state population required the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to adopt more surveillance strategies, that the number of patrol vehicles were not enough to enforce the 2012 road traffic law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Responding, Ambode said &quot;When we had our security council meeting, this was one of the issues raised at the meeting. We know that the helicopters we have at the moment are not combat ready. So we are looking for helicopters that can perform multi-task that is an helicopter that can patrol the state during the day and at night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want to make sure that we keep the state safe always. Whatever strategy it would require for us to have a safe society, this administration will do it to ensure that lives and property are well protected. The final solution is that we must have an integrated security plan in the state that would ensure that we are safe in the air, on land and water. All these will be integrated together using the Nigerian </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The governor noted that vehicles would be provided to patrol the state and adequate fuel would be supplied to ensure movement of the vehicles, adding that his administration would reactivate the fuel collection point and ensure that adequate fuel is provided weekly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Transportation, Mr. Oluseyi Coker, who stressed that the Traffic Law (Schedule 11) which restricts the operations of motorcycle as well as Regulation 16 Sub-sections 4, 5 and 6 of the Law are sacrosanct said: &quot;Section 3 Sub-section 1 of the Law stipulates that &quot;No person shall ride, drive or propel a cart, wheel barrow, motorcycle or tricycle on any of the routes specified in Schedule 11 to this Law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;However, it is disheartening to see that motorcycle operators have resurfaced on our restricted roads especially in areas such as Ikeja, Isolo, Apapa, Agege, Epe, Ijede, Shomolu/ Bariga, Ifako Ijaiye/ Ojokoro, Ikorodu, Mushin, Ketu, Ojota, Lagos Island, Ojodu and Badagry, in spite of the various efforts of the past administrations in the State to ensure that the menace of motorcycle operators is curbed and the rate of accident, injuries and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is reduced drastically in the state.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The present administration of Ambode would not fold its arms and allow lawlessness, indiscipline, flagrant disobedience to law and order, loss of lives and property of innocent citizens of the state to continue unabated,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7"> BODY:<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ONE WEEK before his arrest for a racist rampage at a revered Southern church, Dylann Storm Roof shared an apocalyptic vision of mass murder with a trailer park neighbor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was looking to kill a bunch of people,&quot; recalled Christon Scriven, 22, just hours before his bigoted buddy's arrest for a racially motivated killing spree. &quot;He flat out told us he was going to do this stuff. He's just off in the head . . . Weird.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hate-fueled white gunman was busted Thursday morning after a 14-hour manhunt, suspected in the execution of nine helpless black worshippers inside the historic Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The innocent, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unarmed victims</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ranged in age from 26 to 87 - and included the venerable church's pastor, an acquaintance of President Obama and First Lady Michelle.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chilling details emerged about Roof's racist rants inside the church, the ignored pleas of his victims as he reloaded his handgun five times - and his release of one terrified woman to serve as a witness to the carnage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The shooter said, 'I'm not going to shoot you because I want you to tell everyone what happened,' &quot; Charleston NAACP chapter President Dot Scott told a local newspaper, the Post and Courier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roof arrived at 8 p.m. for the Wednesday prayer meeting, bringing a heart filled with evil and a fully loaded handgun, officials said. He spent an hour with his victims before declaring his murderous intent with a merciless four-word announcement: &quot;You have to go.&quot; Sylvia Johnson, a cousin of the slain pastor, the Rev. Clementa Pinckney, told MSNBC that a survivor recounted how Roof delivered one final crazed comment before the shooting started.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have to do it,&quot; he was quoted as saying. &quot;You rape our women and you're taking over our country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eight of the victims were found dead inside the house of worship with two centuries of history, while the ninth died in the operating room of a nearby hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three people survived the bloodshed, although authorities released no details about the fortunate trio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roof, 21, a high school dropout and accused drug user, was nabbed after driving 245 miles from the church parking lot to the town of Shelby, N.C. - where a woman recognized his black Hyundai and Three Stooges-style bowl haircut.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A terrible human being who would go into a place of worship where people are praying and kill them is now in custody - where he will always remain,&quot; said Charleston Mayor Joseph Riley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mass slaying of the pastor and his flock during an evening Bible study session was immediately labeled a hate crime, even as it echoed sad chapters from America's violent past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama invoked the killing of four black girls in a 1963 Birmingham, Ala., church bombing by the Ku Klux Klan. And the shooting spree harkened to mass killings at the Sandy Hook Elementary School, a Colorado movie theater and the carnage at Virginia Tech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The fact that this took place in a black church obviously . . . raises questions about a dark part of our history,&quot; the President declared. But he also took aim at a Congress that has repeatedly rebuffed White House efforts on gun control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At some point, we as a country will have to reckon with the fact that this type of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And it is in our power to do something about it. I say that, recognizing the politics in this town foreclose a lot of those avenues right now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama noted that he and his wife personally knew some parishioners at the church - including its slain pastor, who was also a South Carolina politician.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In other developments:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">l The FBI learned of Roof's identity when childhood friend Joey Meek, 20, recognized his skinny friend's face and grimy gray sweatshirt in a surveillance camera frame grab from the church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I didn't THINK it was him,&quot; Meek said. &quot;I KNEW it was him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Roof waived both his right to extradition and his right to counsel at a 10-minute North Carolina hearing, clearing the way for his Thursday night return to South Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Cops released Roof's 2015 rap sheet: A Feb. 28 bust for possession of a controlled substance in the local mall and an April 26 arrest for trespassing at the same mall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* An ominous Facebook photo showed the demented mass murder suspect glaring into the camera while wearing a black jacket decorated with an apartheid-era South African flag.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Roof's father, Ben, refused to comment, calling the cops on a reporter at his South Carolina home. The suspect's uncle said the dad's 21st birthday present to Roof in April was a .45-caliber handgun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The South Carolina state Legislature came under fire when the Confederate flag, a symbol of the Civil War and slavery, flew at full staff above the Statehouse after the racist murders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The multiple murder suspect's sister, 27-year-old Amber, is scheduled to get married Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* None of the GOP presidential hopefuls - Sens. Marco Rubio, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz - linked gun control to the mass killing at the annual Faith &amp; Freedom Coalition's convention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton said the time for legislation was now. &quot;We have to be honest,&quot; she said Thursday. &quot;How many people do we need to see cut down before we act?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charleston County Coroner Rae Wooten read off the sad litany of victims' names, noting all were shot to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> without giving any specifics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The best known was the well-respected Rev. Pinckney, 41, who served as both pastor and state senator. Pinckney, the father of two girls and a preaching prodigy since age 13, was elected to the Statehouse at 23 - making him the youngest member of the House at the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three other church officials were also killed: Sharonda Coleman-Singleton, 45; Daniel Simmons, 74; and Mira Thompson, 59. Other victims included longtime parishioner Susie Jackson, 87, and one-time church janitor Ethel Lance, 70.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The others killed were identified as public library branch manager Cynthia Hurd, 54; college enrollment counselor DePayne Doctor, 49; and recent college graduate Tywanza Sanders, 26.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roof's appearance at the church meeting did not alarm any of the worshipers, who are used to drop-ins from tourists visiting the historical building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Authorities said the arrest of the suspect came without incident at 10:49 a.m. after a local citizen spied Roof in his getaway car.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7"> BODY:<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ONE WEEK before his arrest for a racist rampage at a revered Southern church, Dylann Storm Roof shared an apocalyptic vision of mass murder with a trailer park neighbor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was looking to kill a bunch of people,&quot; recalled Christon Scriven, 22, just hours before his bigoted buddy's arrest for a racially motivated killing spree. &quot;He flat out told us he was going to do this stuff. He's just off in the head . . . Weird.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hate-fueled white gunman was busted Thursday morning after a 14-hour manhunt, suspected in the execution of nine helpless black worshippers inside the historic Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The innocent, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unarmed victims</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ranged in age from 26 to 87 - and included the venerable church's pastor, an acquaintance of President Obama and First Lady Michelle.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chilling details emerged about Roof's racist rants inside the church, the ignored pleas of his victims as he reloaded his handgun five times - and his release of one terrified woman to serve as a witness to the carnage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The shooter said, 'I'm not going to shoot you because I want you to tell everyone what happened,' &quot; Charleston NAACP chapter President Dot Scott told a local newspaper - the Post and Courier - the survivor said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roof arrived at 8 p.m. for the Wednesday prayer meeting, bringing a heart filled with evil and a fully loaded handgun, officials said. He spent an hour with his victims before declaring his murderous intent with a merciless four-word announcement: &quot;You have to go.&quot; Sylvia Johnson, a cousin of the slain pastor, the Rev. Clementa Pinckney, told MSNBC that a survivor recounted how Roof delivered one final crazed comment before the shooting started.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have to do it,&quot; he was quoted as saying. &quot;You rape our women and you're taking over our country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eight of the victims were found dead inside the house of worship with two centuries of history, while the ninth died in the operating room of a nearby hospital. Three people survived the bloodshed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roof, 21, a high school dropout and accused drug user, was nabbed after driving 245 miles from the church parking lot to the town of Shelby, N.C. - where a woman recognized his black Hyundai and Three Stooges-style bowl haircut.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A terrible human being who would go into a place of worship where people are praying and kill them is now in custody - where he will always remain,&quot; said Charleston Mayor Joseph Riley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mass slaying of the pastor and his flock during an evening Bible study session was immediately labeled a hate crime, even as it echoed sad chapters from America's violent past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama invoked the killing of four black girls in a 1963 Birmingham, Ala., church bombing by the Ku Klux Klan. And the shooting spree harkened to mass killings at the Sandy Hook Elementary School, a Colorado movie theater and the carnage at Virginia Tech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The fact that this took place in a black church obviously . . . raises questions about a dark part of our history,&quot; the President declared. But he also took aim at a Congress that has repeatedly rebuffed White House efforts on gun control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At some point, we as a country will have to reckon with the fact that this type of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries,&quot; he said. &quot;And it is in our power to do something about it. I say that, recognizing the politics in this town foreclose a lot of those avenues right now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama noted that he and his wife personally knew some parishioners at the church - including its slain pastor, who was also a South Carolina politician.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In other developments:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The FBI learned of Roof's identity when childhood friend Joey Meek, 20, recognized his skinny friend's face and grimy gray sweatshirt in a surveillance camera frame grab from the church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I didn't THINK it was him,&quot; Meek said. &quot;I KNEW it was him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Roof waived both his right to extradition and his right to counsel and was being held pending a bond hearing in South Carolina Thursday night.l Cops released Roof's 2015 rap sheet: A Feb. 28 bust for possession of a controlled substance in the local mall and an April 26 arrest for trespassing at the same mall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* An ominous Facebook photo showed the demented mass murder suspect glaring into the camera while wearing a black jacket decorated with an apartheid-era South African flag.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Roof's father, Ben, refused to comment, calling the cops on a reporter at his South Carolina home. The suspect's uncle said the dad's 21st birthday present to Roof in April was a .45-caliber handgun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The South Carolina state Legislature came under fire when the Confederate flag, a symbol of the Civil War and slavery, flew at full staff above the Statehouse after the racist murders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The multiple murder suspect's sister, 27-year-old Amber, is scheduled to get married Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* None of the GOP presidential hopefuls - Sens. Marco Rubio, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz - linked gun control to the mass killing at the annual Faith &amp; Freedom Coalition's convention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton said the time for legislation was now. &quot;We have to be honest,&quot; she said Thursday. &quot;How many people do we need to see cut down before we act?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charleston County Coroner Rae Wooten read off the sad litany of victims' names, noting all were shot to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The best known was the well-respected Rev. Pinckney, 41, who served as both pastor and state senator. Pinckney, the father of two girls and a preaching prodigy since age 13, was elected to the Statehouse at 23 - making him the youngest member of the House at the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three other church officials were also killed: Sharonda Coleman-Singleton, 45; Rev. Daniel Simmons, 74; and Myra Thompson, 59. Other victims included longtime parishioner Susie Jackson, 87, and one-time church janitor Ethel Lance, 70.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The others killed were identified as public library branch manager Cynthia Hurd, 54; college enrollment counselor DePayne Middleton-Doctor, 49; and recent college grad Tywanza Sanders, 26.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson's niece, Cynthia Taylor, said she had spoken to a survivor, Felecia Sanders, who said she had played dead as she lay on top of her granddaughter to protect them both during the carnage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roof's appearance at the church meeting did not alarm any of the worshipers, who are used to drop-ins from tourists visiting the historical building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Authorities said the arrest of the suspect came without incident at 10:49 a.m. after a local citizen spied Roof in his getaway car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roof, roughly 25 minutes after he was stopped by cops, surrendered quietly. Charleston </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chief Greg Mullen characterized the killer as &quot;cooperative&quot; as he was taken into custody by local </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers. Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">suspect</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was still </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> when approached by cops. Authorities believe Roof acted alone in planning and executing the lethal attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The eagle-eyed citizen, a woman on her way to work at a Shelby florist, recognized Roof's black Hyundai on Highway 74 and called her boss - who dialed cops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I knew it was a black car . . . I saw pictures of him with the bowl cut,&quot; a teary Debbie Dills told the Shelby Star newspaper after spotting the alleged murderer. Roof was fitted by cops with a bulletproof vest and shackles on his hands and feet before he was taken from the local </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> station to court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roof's trailer park pal Scriven, who is black, said the suspected shooter initially plotted to target the College of Charleston and not the church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You don't know when to take him seriously and when not to,&quot; said Scriven. &quot;To be honest, I didn't react (to the news). I was like, 'Awww man, he did that s---.' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said his niece Emily was once in the same eighth-grade class as Roof - described by the GOP presidential hopeful as &quot;one of these whacked out kids.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Graham, after speaking with his sister Darline Nordone and his niece, told CNN that his relatives had nothing positive to say about Roof.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was quiet, strange, very anti-social and everyone thought he was on drugs,&quot; said Graham. &quot;It's about a young man who is obviously twisted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roof could face the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> penalty under South Carolina law or federal hate crime statutes if the case goes that route.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7"> BODY:<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An antiterrorism court issued on Thursday a notice to a prosecutor on a bail application of Muttahida Qaumi Movement leader Aamir Khan in a case pertaining to instigating terrorism and harbouring criminals.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Pakistan Rangers had detained the MQM leader with dozens of other suspects for three-month preventive detention after their arrest during a raid in and around the party headquarters, Nine Zero, in Azizabad on March 11 and recently booked him for allegedly providing shelter to criminals and using them for terrorist activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aamir Khan through his counsel moved a bail application and the judge of ATC-II issued a notice to a special public prosecutor on the application for Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Copies of the prosecution's documents were also provided to the suspect, a mandatory procedure before indictment, as required under Section 265-C (supply of statements and documents to accused) of the criminal procedure code.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prosecution said that the paramilitary force had also arrested 26 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed suspects</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, including Faisal Mehmood alias Mota, who had been sentenced to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by a court in absentia for the murder of journalist Wali Khan Babar, and other wanted and absconding suspects during the March 11 raid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It further said that the MQM leader was in charge of the party headquarters security and he with five others had allegedly provided shelter to arrested criminals and had been using them for terrorist activities in the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A case was registered under Sections 11V (directing terrorist activities), 21J (harbouring any person who committed an offence under this act) and 7 (punishment for act of terrorism) of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 on a complaint of a Rangers official at the Azizabad </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Remand in double murder case extended</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An antiterrorism court extended on Thursday the physical remand of a suspect in a double murder case till July 5.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Umair Hassan Siddiqui, said to be a worker of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement, has been booked for allegedly killing two tea vendors Niaz Gul and Iqbal Hussain in Gulshan-e-Maymar in April 2013.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the end of his first remand, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> again produced the suspect in court. Special public prosecutor of the Rangers Rana Khalid submitted that the suspect was placed under 90-day preventive detention by the paramilitary force in March and he confessed before a joint investigation team to his alleged involvement in dozens of cases of targeted killing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prosecutor sought extension in the physical remand of the suspect for further questioning and arrest of his accomplices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defence lawyer Latif Pasha, who is also a member of the MQM legal aid committee, opposed the extension in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> custody and contended that the allegations were baseless as the prosecution could not bring out any incriminating evidence against the suspect despite keeping him in detention for three months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The judge of the ATC-II granted a 10-day extension in the physical remand of the suspect and asked the investigating </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to produce him in court with a progress report on the next hearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, another ATC remanded on Thursday the same suspect in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> custody for two weeks in a case pertaining to the murder of a paramilitary soldier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The suspect was accused of killing Rangers personnel Shaukat near the Suparco office within the jurisdiction of the Mobina Town </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> station in 2010.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> submitted on Tuesday a charge-sheet in an antiterrorism court against Muttahida Qaumi Movement leader Aamir Khan in a case of instigating terrorism and harbouring criminals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Pakistan Rangers had detained the MQM leader with dozens of other suspects for three months following their arrest during a raid in and around the party headquarters, Nine Zero, in Azizabad on March 11 and recently booked him for allegedly providing shelter to criminals and using them for terrorist activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The investigating </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inspector Mohsin Hasan Zaidi, through a special public prosecutor of Rangers submitted the investigation report in court in which he charge-sheeted Aamir Khan for allegedly instigating terrorism and harbouring criminals.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IO did not name anyone as absconding accused and placed six officials of Rangers and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as prosecution witnesses in the charge-sheet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After admitting the investigation report for hearing, the ATC-II judge fixed June 25 for supply of copies of the report to the suspect, a mandatory procedure before indictment, as required under Section 265-C (supply of statements and documents to accused) of the criminal procedure code.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The paramilitary force had placed the MQM leader with around 60 others under 90-day preventive detention after the raid and informed court that they had credible information about their alleged involvement in offences related to targeted killing and terrorism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On June 4, the Rangers handed Aamir Khan over to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> after registering a case against him and the following day </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> got his one-week physical remand. On June 12, court remanded the MQM leader in prison and asked the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to file an investigation report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the prosecution, around 59 suspects, including Aamir Khan, were placed under preventive detention and the paramilitary force had also arrested 26 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed suspects</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, including Faisal Mehmood alias Mota, who was sentenced to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by a court in absentia for the murder of journalist Wali Khan Babar; Obaid alias K2, who was wanted in many cases; and Noman alias Nomi, an absconder in the Advocate Niamat Ali Randhawa murder case during the March 11 raid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It alleged that the MQM leader and others admitted during questioning that Aamir Khan was in charge of the party headquarters security and he with Minhaj Qazi, Raees Mama, Shahzad Mullah, Imran Ijaz Niazi and Naeem alias Mullah had allegedly provided shelter to the arrested suspects and had been using them for terrorist activities in the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A joint investigation team recommended the registration of a case against the MQM leader and others, the prosecution concluded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case was registered under Sections 11V (directing terrorist activities), 21J (harbouring any person who committed an offence under this act) and 7 (punishment for act of terrorism) of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 on a complaint of Rangers Deputy Superintendent Ashraf Hussain at the Azizabad </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rangers detain 11 ST men for three months</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pakistan Rangers, Sindh, informed an antiterrorism court on Tuesday about the 90-day preventive detention of 11 workers of the Sunni Tehreek (ST) for questioning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rangers along with their legal team produced Rizwan alias Guddu, Arif Mansoori, Jawad Qadri, Akram alias Kala, Farhan alias Baba, Imran Saeedi, Muhammad Alam, Shakeel alias Fuji, Salman alias Mirchi, Zubair Ali and Noor Alam in the chamber of the judge in charge of the ATC-III, Akhlaq Hussain Larak, amid tight security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They submitted that the detainees were picked up during a raid on the office of the ST upon receiving credible information about their involvement in targeted killing, extortion and other offences which fall within the ambit of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7"> BODY:<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE ACQUITTAL Saturday of a white Cleveland cop for firing the final blasts of a 137-shot </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> barrage that killed two unarmed blacks ignited outrage and protests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police Officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Michael Brelo, 31, was the only one of the 13 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who opened fire in November 2012 to face criminal charges - and a Cleveland judge found him not guilty in the bench trial.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors charged Brelo unloaded 49 shots, including a 15-bullet fusillade while standing on the hood of the car and blasting through the windshield at victims Timothy Russell, 43, and Malissa Williams, 30.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brelo wept, held his head in his hands and occasionally made the sign of the cross as Judge John O'Donnell found him not guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting followed a 62-car, 100 mph chase that one prosecutor said looked like a clip from the movie &quot;The Blues Brothers.&quot; The chase was triggered in downtown Cleveland after cops reacted to what they believed was a gunshot, but was instead Russell's Chevy Malibu backfiring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Russell was shot 23 times, and Williams was struck by 24 bullets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neither </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">victim was armed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More than 200 angry but peaceful protesters immediately took to the Cleveland streets, some carrying signs asking, &quot;Will I be next?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Racial tensions in Cleveland were already strained by the killing six months ago of Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old black boy shot to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by a rookie white cop. The pre-teen was carrying a pellet gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This verdict is another chilling reminder of a broken relationship between the Cleveland </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> department and the community it serves,&quot; said U.S. Rep. Marcia Fudge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cleveland community activist Carole Steiner agreed: &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> murder people of color and not have to serve one day in jail.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Russell's sister, Michelle, called for peaceful protests and stressed the ruling was not the final word.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's not going to dodge this just because he was acquitted,&quot; she said. &quot;God will have the final say.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the U.S. Justice Department may get a crack at the case first. A review of evidence in the state trial could lead to a federal civil rights prosecution of Brelo, who was facing 22 years in prison before being cleared of voluntary manslaughter.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An antiterrorism court on Friday remanded Muttahida Qaumi Movement leader Amir Khan in judicial custody in a case of instigating terrorism and harbouring criminals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the end of his one-week physical remand, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> produced the MQM leader in court again amid tight security.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The investigating </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> submitted that he be sent to prison as his custody was no longer needed for questioning. The ATC-II judge sent Amir Khan to prison on judicial remand till June 25 and asked the IO to submit an investigation report till next hearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defence lawyer Shaukat Hayat moved an application seeking B-class (better facilities) in prison for the MQM leader by submitting that his client was entitled to it under Section 248 of the Prison Rules as he was a postgraduate and also a taxpayer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court provisionally allowed the application subject to the verification of the degree and tax record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The MQM leader was picked up with dozens of other suspects by the Rangers in a pre-dawn raid on and around the party headquarters Nine Zero in Azizabad on March 11.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While placing them under 90-day preventive detention, the paramilitary force had informed a court that they had credible information about their alleged involvement in crimes related to targeted killing and terrorism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On June 4, the Rangers handed over the MQM leader to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> after registering a case against him and others for allegedly harbouring criminals and using them for terrorist activities and the following day he was remanded in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> custody for a week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the FIR, besides around 59 suspects, including Amir Khan, placed under preventive detention, the paramilitary force had also arrested during the March 11 raid 26 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed suspects</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, including Faisal Mehmood alias Faisal Mota, who was sentenced to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by a court in absentia for the murder of journalist Wali Khan Babar; Obaid alias K2, who was wanted in many cases; and Noman alias Nomi, an absconder in the Advocate Niamat Ali Randhawa murder case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It alleged that the MQM leader and others admitted during questioning that Amir Khan was in charge of the party headquarters security and he with Minhaj Qazi, Raees Mama, Shahzad Mullah, Imran Ijaz Niazi and Naeem alias Mullah had allegedly provided shelter to arrested criminals and had been using them for terrorist activities in the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A joint investigation team recommended the registration of a case against the MQM leader and others, the FIR concluded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case was registered at the Azizabad </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> station on a complaint of Rangers Deputy Superintendent Ashraf Hussain under Sections 11V (directing terrorist activities), 21J (harbouring any person who committed an offence under this act) and 7 (punishment for act of terrorism) of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have issued a warrant for the arrest of a 34-year-old Surrey man wanted in the Mother's Day domestic slaying of a young mom.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gordon Alexander David, also known as Alex David, is accused of killing his wife, Cady Quaw, 23. He is wanted for manslaughter and aggravated assault, and is believed to be armed and dangerous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Integrated Homicide Investigation Team issued the notice Monday, a day after </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> found Quaw injured in a basement suite in the 9400-block 140th Street. Quaw succumbed to her injuries in hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another woman was also found injured in the home. She remains in stable condition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rita Quaw was stunned to hear about the news of her cousin's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a shock,&quot; said the 38-yearold Penticton woman. &quot;I felt like it's finally sunk in today. I babysat her for most of my life, and I feel like crap.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Quaw has a large family who are grieving their loss. She leaves behind a daughter, who she took care of in Surrey, and a son, who lived in northern B.C., said Rita.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her cousin was a soft-spoken and quiet woman, but strong, said Rita: &quot;She was going through a lot of stuff, but she was very loving, especially towards her dad and mom and brothers and sister.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rita said Quaw spent her childhood on the Saik'uz First Nation reserve outside Vanderhoof. David was from the same reserve and the two grew up together.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A STREET vendor was killed in the crossfire between security guards and robbers at the Gugulethu Mall on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Farai Fambira, a 39-year-old Zimbabwean, made a living selling DVDs, CDs and padlocks at the entrance of the mall, to support his wife and three children who live in Zimbabwe.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fambira had just set up his stall when a group of five robbers attempted to rob a cash-in-transit vehicle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Witnesses said Fambira hid behind a dairy truck when the shooting started.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We all fell to the ground as soon as we heard the gunshots. Rasta (Fambira) hid behind that truck because it was closest to his stall.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Witnesses say that the security guards may have mistaken Fambira for a robber.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We kept shouting that he wasn't one of the robbers but the security guards just wouldn't stop shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There were many shots, the two guards were standing over Rasta and one was even kicking him,&quot; said street vendor Phumeza Mangaliso.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> spokesman Andr&Atilde;&uml; Traut confirmed the incident and said one of the robbers was injured and was in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> custody.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Five </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed suspects</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> opened fire on two security </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who were transporting cash, and in the crossfire a male bystander was fatally wounded. One of the suspects was wounded and subsequently arrested and is being treated ,&quot; said Traut.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the security guards escaped unharmed and no cash was stolen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The remaining four suspects fled the scene and are yet to be arrested. The matter is still under investigation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Togar Mabharani, Fambira's relative said he was woken by people who were at the scene when his cousin was killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the witnesses they tried to shout and inform the security guards that he was not one of the robbers but they went ahead and shot him |anyway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was not a criminal, he just sold his things to feed his family,&quot; says Mabharani.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A BRITISH &quot;Wolverine&quot; wannabe who slaughtered three family members before fleeing the scene has been found dead, cops said Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Authorities found the body of Jed Allen, a 21-year-old obsessed with the hairy, clawed comic book character, in a wooded area in Oxford, some 13 miles north of the gruesome triple-murder scene in Didcot.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The family home in the tranquil Thames Valley was turned into a blood-spattered mess after the disturbed, knife-obsessed Allen went on a Saturday rampage, murdering his mother, Janet Jordon, 48; her boyfriend, Philip Howard, 44, and the couple's 6-year-old daughter, Derrin - his sister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Members of the public reported finding the body of a man in a wooded area in Oxford, in Marston Road,&quot; Detective Superintendent Chris Ward, of the Thames Valley </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said at a news conference Monday evening, Sky News reported. &quot;This is an area that had not been previously searched by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as a result of this investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No formal identification has taken place but I am satisfied that this is the body of Jed Allen, who I had previously named as a suspect in this investigation,&quot; Ward said. &quot;The members of all of the victims' families have been informed, and they are being supported by specially trained </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While the investigation into this matter will continue, I am not seeking anybody else in connection with the offense,&quot; he added. &quot;I would like to offer my condolences to all of the families of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">victims</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in this tragic case.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Armed police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had been desperately seeking the tattooed weightlifter, who had posted a series of bizarre, rambling videos online before the triple homicide. He also left dozens of photos on his social media accounts, detailing a fascination with weapons and brooding comic book anti-heroes, primarily X-Men's Wolverine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Allen, sporting the character's signature sideburns, posed in one selfie with serrated steak knives arranged between his fingers like claws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;F--- it's wolverine,&quot; he wrote in the caption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In other pics, he brandished an ax, bolt clippers and a 10-inch hunting knife.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's unclear how the wanted killer died.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A second defendant charged in the same incident reportedly committed suicide after being sought in connection with an unrelated murder case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amber Rae Melton has pleaded not guilty to three indictments for aggravated robbery with a deadly weapon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A pretrial hearing is set Tuesday morning in the 354th District Court, with jury selection currently scheduled for June 1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The indictments involve the alleged </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">victims</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> robbery reported in Greenville early on the morning of July 19, 2014.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Melton was alleged to have been acting alongside Thomas Isaac Medlin of Dallas in the theft of a pickup truck at gunpoint. Melton remains in custody at the Hunt County Jail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three individuals told </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  with the Greenville </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Department they met Medlin and Melton at a local store and agreed to give them a ride across town in a 2005 Chevrolet pick-up.

Medlin and Melton then allegedly left in the stolen truck.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Medlin pleaded guilty in September 2014 to a reduced charge of robbery and was released on probation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But an arrest warrant on a charge of murder was later issued for Medlin, involving the Nov. 10, 2014 homicide of Eddie Cabellero Lopez in Greenville.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TWO Portland men were remanded in custody yesterday after being charged with serious assault offences relating to a horrific home invasion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Daniel Hollands, 27, of Finn Street, did not apply for bail, while Payton Reiri, 22, of Daniel Street, was refused bail in the Warrnambool Magistrates Court.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were remanded in custody until a filing hearing on September 22.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> alleged Mr Hollands, Mr Reiri and other armed men went to a Portland home in Waratah Crescent on Thursday last week and bashed and stabbed a drug dealer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The victim suffered a severe laceration to his left cheek which exposed his teeth and required 27 stitches .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other injuries included multiple fractures to his arms, legs, fingers, knee, feet and face. He is expected to remain in a Melbourne hospital for about 10 weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 16-year-old girl was also hit with a baseball bat, suffering a fracture to her back, and the incident happened while there was a nine-year-old boy in the home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detective Sergeant James Sullivan, of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> crime squad, told the court the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">victim</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was a low-level drug dealer and Mr Hollands was his competition. He said the victim was told to stop trafficking drugs, threatened and told to leave Portland, which he did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he had recently returned and there was an $18,000 bounty on his head for anyone who assaulted him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detective Sergeant Sullivan said the reason the girl was assaulted was because she had not told Mr Hollands and Mr Reiri the victim was back in town. He said the girl told </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officers that police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had &quot;signed her </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> warrant&quot; if Mr Hollands and Mr Reiri were released from custody.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the offences the men have been charged with, intentionally causing serious injury in circumstances of gross violence, carries a minimum four-year jail sentence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detective Sergeant Sullivan said it was usual that the only question Mr Reiri asked of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was who had named him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said to call it a stabbing was to understate the action of Mr Hollands, with the victim's wound going from high on the cheekbone to the jaw.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He has deliberately run the blade along his face,&quot; Detective Sergeant Sullivan said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detective Senior Constable Tim McKerracher said Mr Reiri was armed with a metal baseball bat and Mr Hollands with a knife. He said the men surrounded the home and then forced entry by kicking in the front and back door. When the victim tried to barricade himself in a bedroom, the men forced their way in and struck him more than 50 times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was dragged out of the bedroom, struck about 200 times and then stabbed the man to the face by Mr Hollands while he was held down by Mr Reiri.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detective Senior Constable McKerracher said </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were hopeful of identifying other co-accused and now that the two men had been arrested it was likely other witnesses would come forward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Magistrate John Lesser refused bail, saying Mr Reiri was an unacceptable risk of interfering with witnesses and reoffending.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 42 people were, yesterday, reportedly killed in Benue and Plateau States during separate attacks by unknown gunmen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twenty seven persons were said to have been killed in some communities in Barkin Ladi Local Government Area of Plateau State while 15 others were killed at the popular Kyado Market in Ukum Local Government Area of Benue State, bringing the total number of those killed in the two neighbouring states to 42.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The victims in Plateau State were killed during a night attack despite the curfew imposed on the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Benue, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">victims</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were killed Wednesday afternoon when unknown </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> men opened fire on traders at the market even as many, including children, also sustained varying degrees of injuries at the marker popularly known for its booming yam trade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Barkin Ladi in Plateau was one of the seven local governments where curfew was imposed but night attacks had been going on daily for about three weeks now with many people mostly women and children being killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chairman of the council, Emmanuel Loman, who confirmed the attack, yesterday, blamed the incident on some Fulani herdsmen who he said attacked both Ninji and Popp villages without provocation, killing 20 persons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;As I talk to you, I am at the mass burial of 27 people killed by the Fulani and their mercenaries. The act is being perpetrated by the Fulani who live in the communities and aided by their mercenaries. The attackers want to make Barkin Ladi another Sambisa forest at all cost.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He, therefore, called on security operatives to be proactive as the situation was getting out of hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Residents of the area and neighbouring Riyom Local Government Area had been also under severe attack in the last three days with many residents relocating to other areas for fear of being killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, in Makurdi, the Benue State capital, an eye witness told Vanguard that the gunmen, who were about six in number, stormed the ever busy market located close to Wukari, along the Benue-Taraba State border, at about 12:30pm at the peak of trading activities</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They stormed the market in a commando manner, when business activities were at peak at about 12:30pm, and suddenly opened fire on the traders and their customers, most of whom were trading in tubers of yam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was pandemonium everywhere, people, including children, started scampering in different directions but unfortunately, about 13 persons were killed by the gunmen, while many also sustained injuries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After the sporadic shooting which lasted about 10 minutes, the gunmen retreated to the car they came in and drove off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Contacted, Benue State </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Public Relations </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Officer,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> PPRO, Assistant Superintendent, ASP, Austin Ezeani, confirmed the killings, saying the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> recorded the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of three persons and five cases of injuries in the incident.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">anipur, June 5 -- In a devastating ambush this morning on a five-vehicle convoy of the 6-Dogra Regiment in the Moltuk area of Chandel district of Manipur, 110 km from Tengnoupal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Police</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Station, close to the Indo-Myanmar border, at least 17 soldiers were reported killed and 16 others injured. The soldiers who had completed their posting at the remote Moltuk village were leaving with their bags and baggage, and probably with home in mind rather than a gunfight, putting themselves off guard and therefore made extremely vulnerable. The attackers probably also had intelligence of this vulnerable moment and timed the ambush accordingly. Claims are now beginning to come to newspaper offices, and so far they confirm suspicions that this could have been the handiwork of the newly formed, United Liberation Front of Western South East Asia, ULFWSEA, constituting of a number of insurgent groups from the Northeast, under the leadership of SS Khaplang, the chief of the National Socialist Council of Nagaland, NSCN, faction with which the Government of India had only recently called off its ceasefire. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Khaplang on the other hand still holds a ceasefire with the Myanmar government. Nearly all of the insurgent groups from not just Manipur but also the entire Northeast, now have their bases in Myanmar enjoying the safe sanctuary provided by Khaplang. The Government of India ended its truce with Khaplang faction of the NSCN thinking it to have been reduced to a spent force in India, and to pursue peace with the stronger rival NSCN faction led by Isak Swu and Thuingaleng Muivah with which it has been holding peace talks since 1997. Today's ambush could be Khaplang's message that he can still hit back within Indian territory in many different ways, apart from dramatically announcing the arrival of ULFSEA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today's deadly ambush changed the complexion of a public outrage building up over the killing of a woman, M Ruisoting Aimol, a 56 year old social activist belonging to a small tribe Aimol in the Chandel district, by troops of the 20 Assam Rifles posted at Bonyang village. According to the villagers, the soldiers, accompanied by an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> came to the village in a white Maruti Gypsy with some masked men at 9.45pm on May 31 and searched out the woman. They then planted some incriminating items at her place before shooting and injuring her. Villagers thereafter brought her to a hospital in Imphal where she succumbed to her injury on June 2. The villagers further allege that the soldiers had also earlier come to the village at 11.35pm on June 27 and harassed the villagers. The news of this atrocity remained lost in the din of the hotly contested Autonomous District Council elections in the hill districts, polling for which was held on June 1. However after the dust of the electioneering settled, public attention shifted back to the case of the murdered woman. The Aimol tribe called a general strike, and several civil society bodies all over the state responded to the call. However, no sooner did the strike begin, it was called off following a truce brokered by the Manipur government between the aggrieved Aimol tribe and the Assam Rifles. In Manipur's absurd theatre today, even grief and mourning are open to bargain and negotiation. This is understandable, considering the climate of official impunity introduced by the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Armed</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Forces Special Powers Act. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Victims</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> virtually have no guarantee at all that perpetrators will be punished, so rather than lose everything, the intuition now is to bargain for some material compensation at least. In most cases the price demanded is a government job or cash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today's devastating ambush and the atrocious killing of the Aimol woman a few days earlier, illustrate the tragedy of a violent civil strife and the dilemma before the liberal State to come up with a liberal answer; a failure of the moral imagination. Often, in the AFSPA debate so sensitive in the Northeast region, the two kinds of violence are so falsely aligned on the &quot;us versus them&quot; binary, making them either the justification or else a case for condemning draconian measures of the State. The AFSPA debate thus gets reduced to the instrumental &quot;you hit me first&quot; rhetoric, or that of extraordinary situations deserving extraordinary measures. Lost in the process is the ethical question of whether the end always justifies the means. Placing the two kinds of violence on opposite poles is also false for one more thing. The objection to the AFSPA is not so much to the military meeting a military challenge to the State. It is more about making the atrocities committed under the AFSPA accountable to democratic law. This is what the Justice Jeevan Reddy Committee's recommendation on the AFSPA said in 2005; this is also what the Veerappa Moily Administrative Reform Committee 2005 recommended; this is what Santosh Hegde Commission on encounter </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">deaths</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Manipur 2013 also said. Let the AFSPA debate then not be swayed by the immediate and instead be thrashed out on the moral plane.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maurice Henderson is a fiddler on Fetlar (population 69), a beautiful island in the Shetland archipelago 150 or so miles north of the Scottish mainland, and has spent his life bringing the old music and tales of his native land to a new global audience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet he would not have existed at all had his great-great-great-greatgreat-great-grandfather not saved his great-great-greatgreat-great-great-grandmother from the nest of a hungry eagle, high on sea cliffs a few miles from what is now the Henderson family croft house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was my grand-uncle who told me I was descended from the eagle's bairn,&quot; the 40-year-old says. &quot;It's a story handed down by folk on the isle for generations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is how it goes. One late summer's day in 1690 on the island of Unst, a white-tailed eagle - a bird with an 8ft wingspan also known as the sea eagle - swooped down to the fields where the Anderson family were gathering barley and picked up in its scimitar talons their infant daughter Mary, who had been lying sleeping in a woollen shawl.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bird set off across the water to its eyrie on the neighbouring island of Fetlar, three miles south. Mary's father William and fellow crofters set off in pursuit, crossing the water in an old leaky boat, straining to see the black dot in the sky. Landing on Fetlar, they made for the cliffs and, arriving above the spot where the bird was known to nest, let down a rope 400ft above the water.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A local boy, Robert Nicolson, being light and used to climbing, volunteered to descend to the nest. There he found Mary asleep and unharmed, the thick shawl having protected her from hungry beaks. He gathered her to him, climbed back up the rope and handed her to her grateful father.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some years later, Nicolson had business on Unst and took a notion to visit the Anderson croft to pay his respects to Mary. He found her grown into a pretty young woman. &quot;It was love at first sight,&quot; says Maurice Henderson, &quot;or, as they say, second sight.&quot; The two married and raised a family. Their descendants - the bairns of the eagle's bairn - still live on the islands and are proud of their ancestry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sea eagle has not been so fortunate in its genealogy. The last in the UK was killed in Shetland in 1918. The female bird had lived for years without a mate and was said to be an albino, the end of her line, a ghost even before she was shot dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This story illustrates the complex and often uneasy relationship between humans and sea eagles, a relationship that led to their dying out in Britain almost 100 years ago and to their reintroduction from Norway in the 1970s. As that grim centenary approaches, it is thought that the milestone of there being 100 breeding pairs is about to be reached. We killed them and then we brought them back to life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The sea eagle was brought to extinction through man's persecution, so it seemed only right that we should do something to bring it back,&quot; says the naturalist and author John Love. &quot;Righting a wrong that had been done to it in the past.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Love, 68, was hired by the former Nature Conservancy Council in 1975 to manage the reintroduction programme. Over the next decade he made several journeys to Norway, where sea eagles are relatively abundant, to choose chicks in their nests and accompany them back - in RAF Nimrods - to Scotland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first bird, Loki, was released on the Hebridean island of Rum on September 26, 1975. Love remembers the moment vividly, its historic weight. &quot;I got the same buzz every time I released one into the world,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sea eagle is Britain's biggest bird of prey. Its relationship with the people of these isles goes back to ancient times; they may even have been sacred to us. When the &quot;Tomb of the Eagles&quot;, a Stone Age burial mound, was excavated in Orkney in 1976, it was found to contain talons and skulls of sea eagles, mingled with the bones of prehistoric humans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pictish symbol stones and the Book of Kells show the great hooked beak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anglo-Saxon poetry describes sea eagles feasting on the flesh of slain warriors. Gaelic poetry calls it &quot;iolaire suil na greine&quot; - the eagle of the sunlit eye. Those golden eyes, which now scan some of Scotland's wildest landscape, once looked down over the whole of the British Isles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Farmers, gamekeepers and sportsmen hastened the demise of the sea eagle. Estate owners regarded them as vermin preying on valuable sheep and game birds, and offered bounties for eggs and severed heads. By 1800 there were none left in England (an attempt five years ago to reintroduce them in East Anglia failed in the face of local opposition).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The last bird in the UK, that albino in Shetland, was photographed a few years before its </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">death.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Blurred and grainy, it is the only picture taken of a true native British sea eagle and there is something guilt-inducing and wraithlike about it; a phantom accusing its killers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although initial reintroductions took place on Rum in 1975, 10 years passed before breeding succeeded and a chick hatched - the first &quot;Gaelic-speaking sea eagle&quot;, as Love puts it, to be born in Scotland for decades. This happened on Mull, a large island south of Rum, to which the birds had spread. It was May 4, 1985, and on the 30th anniversary Dave Sexton, a Royal Society for the Protection of Birds </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">officer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who witnessed the hatching, leads the way down a rough track and points out the site of the nest where new birds are raising young. &quot;This is where it all began,&quot; he says. &quot;This wood should be a national monument.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sea eagles are protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act, with a maximum penalty of six months imprisonment and/or fines of up to &pound;5,000. The Mull birds have been targeted by egg thieves in the past; some nests are protected by security cameras and razor wire. There are 20 nests on Mull, the exact locations of which are kept hush-hush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are valuable birds from both an environmental and economic perspective. Mull is marketed as &quot;Eagle Island&quot; and it is estimated that the birds attract &pound;5m of tourism a year. Even on a wet day the open deck of the Mull Charters boat is busy with visitors wowing at the sea eagles swooping down to take fish from Loch Buie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Is that not the most spectacular thing you've ever seen?&quot; asks Martin Keivers, the boat's skipper. Perhaps, but &quot;spectacular&quot; is not the right word. &quot;Awesome&quot;, in its true sense, is better. &quot;Dreadful&quot; would be better still. A sea eagle in silhouette, circling 100ft above, has a heavy, oppressive, almost hostile presence that brings to mind a bomber aircraft. You can all but hear the engine of the Junkers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trick is to balance the magnetic pull these birds exert on tourists with the need to keep them safe. An informal network of islanders observes the nests and reports any suspicious characters to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">police.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mary van Heerden, known as &quot;Eagle Mary&quot;, is 69 and moved to Mull from Zimbabwe 10 years ago, feeling forced out of the country amid growing security fears. She had been the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">victim</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">armed</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> robbery that left her traumatised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She started running a B&amp;B on Mull, but suffered periods of depression until one day in 2007 Sexton asked her to keep an eye on a pair of eagles about to nest. She has watched them ever since, enjoying the sound of the wind in their wings as they fly overhead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After two or three hours, I come back feeling all is right with the world,&quot; she says. &quot;It has been a wonderful therapy. I pride myself that I've never taken antidepressants. I've never had counselling. These eagles are better.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not everyone regards them so positively. Many farmers on Mull would happily see them die out once more. Sheep farming is an important part of the island's culture and economy; lamb is part of the sea eagle diet. Between those two facts lies anger and conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's an escalating problem,&quot; says Lachlan MacLean, 55, the third generation of his family to farm on Mull. &quot;It's having a huge impact.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MacLean farms 10,000 acres and keeps 2,500 ewes. It was on his land, in 1985, that the first sea eagle hatched. But he takes no pride in this. That beak poking free from the egg was, for him, the beginning of a disaster. He says there are now four nests on the farm, four on the periphery and a number of non-nesting juveniles. &quot;We're surrounded.&quot; Putting a number on the livestock he loses to sea eagles is difficult, he admits, but says the losses are significant. A lamb sells for about &pound;60 and females are worth more than that in subsidy. A new scheme offers financial support to farmers who have nests on their land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But MacLean says he is still losing money and would like bird numbers to be somehow controlled, or for compensation to be paid by the Scottish government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a feeling among farmers that these birds have been imposed on them and - although no sea eagle on Mull has been shot since reintroduction - a sense of envy of great-grandfathers who were not prevented by law from taking action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are thought to be about 50 or so sea eagles on Mull, although there are also populations across the Hebrides, down the west coast and on the other side of the country in Fife. It is likely that this month, or next, the 100th breeding pair will be confirmed. &quot;That feels like an important milestone,&quot; says Sexton. And the future? &quot;I would say that 250 pairs in Scotland over the next 20, 30 years is a reasonable target.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This will be music to the ears of conservationists and tourist businesses, but for MacLean it sounds a discordant note. &quot;They were extinct for a reason,&quot; he says. &quot;We were better off prior to the birds being here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back on Shetland, Henderson is walking along the cliffs, high above the hungry sea. We have been to the old ruined croft where the bird is said to have lifted the bairn and we are now on Fetlar, looking for the site of the nest. Henderson is a member of the folk group Fiddlers' Bid and keen on the folklore of these islands, but this is the first time he has made this pilgrimage, following the flight of the eagle. It is an auspicious moment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The local press is reporting the arrival of sea eagles on Orkney, to the south, so it's only a matter of time before they are back on Shetland, the scene of their extinction becoming a cradle of their resurrection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He stands near the edge, looking down on the crag where he believes the nest must have been. Strange to think if that boy long ago hadn't had the courage to climb down a rope and rescue a baby, their descendant would not now be taking pictures. That's if you believe the legend. Henderson does and is grateful. &quot;I would have missed out on a lot of fiddle tunes,&quot; he laughs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That sea eagle almost cost him his life. We have cost the eagles theirs. Now humans and birds must learn to live together. It is, as Sexton puts it, &quot;an uneasy peace&quot; at times, but one, surely, that is worth trying to keep.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spectacular is not the right word. Dreadful is better. A sea eagle 100ft above has a heavy, almost hostile presence that brings to mind a bomber. You can all but hear the engine of the Junkers</SPAN></P>
